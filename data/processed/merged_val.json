The single button will control both fields.)\nSearch Flexibility\n: The search function should be case-insensitive, space-insensitive, and punctuation-insensitive.\nFor example, queries like \"McDaniel,\" \"mcdaniel,\" and \"mc daniel\" return the same results.\nQueries like \"O'Brien,\" \"obrien,\" and \"o brien\" should also return the same results.\n(See discussion comments below)\nRecord Selection\n: After performing a search, users should be able to select a record from a list of results and view detailed voter information.\nSearch Through Active and Former Names\n: The system should allow searches through both active names and alternative/former names for comprehensive results.\n- The search function must return all possible matches for a given query, regardless of case, space, or punctuation differences.\n- Users should be able to select a record from a list to view detailed information.\n- The system allows name searches using parsed fields: Suffix, First name (full or initial), Middle name (full or initial), Full last name (including hyphenated names), and any Previous or Alternate names.\n- The search tool includes the ability to look up streets by whole or partial name and display their location on a district/precinct map.\n- It is possible to define search criteria flexibly and search through both active and alternative/former names.\nProvide a search function that:\nReturns all matches for a given piece(s) of data and provides a list from which the user may select a record (\u201cclick-through\u201d to detailed information)\nIs case, space, and punctuation insensitive (e.g. a query of \u201cMcDaniel\u201d, \u201cmcdaniel\u201d,or \"mc daniel\" return the same result, and likewise \"obrien\", \"o brien,\" or \"O'Brien\") ?\nAllows a name search of voter registration files using the following parsed fields:\nSuffix (Sr, Jr, other generations as a drop-down menu option for standardization)\nFirst name (full or initial)\nMiddle name (full or initial)\nFull last name (can include hyphenated last name)\nAlternate name (such as hyphenated, two last names, etc.,)\nAllows users to look up streets by whole or partial street name, districts, and precincts--and by user-defined criteria--with a display of where that address is on the district/precinct map\nAllows users to search through active names and alternative/former names",
