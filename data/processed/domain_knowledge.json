The original source contributors\nand their contributions\ncannot\naffect the cash balance of the\ncommittees and are for display disclosure only.\nSpecific Requirements:\n1.\nNew Schedule on CFRs\nIf an Original Source contribution has been entered,\nCFRs must include a new filing schedule, Schedule A-2, to display the Original\nSource contribution\n2.\nNew Contribution sub-category &\nfunctionality\nWhen a committee is entering a new Contribution,\nfrom the Contribution Type menu, there will be an option to select \u2018Original\nSource\u2019\nWhen\nContribution Type: Original Source is selected, the fields for Amount, Date,\nand Description will continue to get pushed down until appropriately placed\nunder an Original Contributor entry\nWhen\nContribution Type: Original Source is selected, the Funding Source menu will\nhave \u2018Contributors donating more than $10,000\u2019 as the only option\nWhen Funding Source Contributors Donating More\nthan $10,000 is selected, a new field titled \u2018Applicable Contributors\u2019 appears,\nand when clicked, displays a menu listing all contributors whose contributions\naggregate to more than $10,000 in an election cycle\nWhen an Applicable Contributor is selected, a field\ntitled \u2018Original Contributor Type\u2019 appears, and when clicked, displays a menu\nlisting: Individual, Commercial Source, Political Party Committee, Political\nAction Committee, Ballot Question Committee, and Nonprofit Organization\nLike\nin current functionality, the site allows selection from currently registered\nPolitical Party Committees, Political Action Committees, and Ballot Question\nCommittees if one of those Original Contributor Types is chosen\nLike in current functionality, the site either\nmatches entry with pre-entered Contributors, respective to type (e.g.,\nIndividual or Commercial Source), or offers \u2018+ Add a New Contributor\u2019 with all\ncurrently offered fields depending on type (e.g., has fields for Occupation and\nEmployer for Individuals)\nOnce\nan Original Contributor is entered or selected, the Original Contribution\nfields of Amount and Date should follow underneath\nOnce\nall required information is entered (i.e., Contribution Type: Original Source,\nFunding Source: Contributors donating more than $10,000, Applicable Contributor\nis chosen, Original Contributor Type is chosen, Original Contributor\ninformation [name, address, occupation and employer information for\nIndividuals], and Original Contribution information [date and amount], an\noption below appears to \u2018Add another Original Contributor\u2019, and the process can\nbe repeated, to add multiple Original Contributors under one Applicable Contributor\n3.\nNew warning and possible new Limit functionality\nWhenever a contribution is entered under a\ncontributor that makes the aggregate contributed amount more than $10,000 for\nthat contributor, the system will generate a warning telling the filer an Original\nSource Contribution must be entered for that contributor\nThis should be similar to the current system\nsettings and functionality regarding Limits and over-the-limit contribution\nwarnings, and this new warning could possibly be piggybacked onto Limits\n4.\nBusiness rules for new functionality\nOriginal Contribution amounts do\nnot\nhave\nto equal the aggregate contributed amount from the Applicable Contributor\nOriginal Source transactions must be able to be\ndeleted, amended, and edited like any other transaction\nOriginal Source and Original Contribution amounts\ndo\nnot\ninfluence the cash balance of the committee\nEssentially,\nthey should be treated very similarly to In-Kind Contributions\nFor reporting purposes, the date assigned to the\nOriginal Source transaction is the date of the contribution that exceeded\n$10,000 in aggregate for the Applicable Contributor\nOnce reported, Original Source transactions and\nSchedule A-2 appear on all subsequently filed reports for the election cycle",

    "Description": "Outgoing Correspondence Management\nThe Correspondence Management Dashboard is a comprehensive tool for managing outgoing and incoming voter registration, election, and district-related correspondence. It optimizes efficiency by organizing notices into actionable categories, enabling batch processing, and providing robust search capabilities.\nThe interface groups outgoing notices into distinct buckets based on categories such as voter registration, election, and district changes. The dashboard displays only the buckets that have queued notices ready for printing. Users can interact with these buckets by selecting individual or entire batches of notices, reviewing, printing, or removing them from the queue. Once an item is printed from the correspondence batch, a copy of the printed item is automatically attached to the recipient\u2019s record for future reference. Below the buckets, users can search for previously created correspondence using specific criteria. A results grid will populate beneath the search fields, showing items that can be printed, viewed, or removed from the system.\nBusiness Goals:\nIncrease operational efficiency in processing voter-related correspondence\nReduce errors in correspondence management by integrating tracking and logging directly into user records.\nUser Goals:\nEnable seamless viewing of correspondence from a single dashboard.\nProvide quick access and searching capabilities for past correspondence.\nAutomatically attach and archive printed notices with recipient records for easy future reference.\nFunctional Requirements:\nAbility to bulk print (generate notices)\nAbility to set date of print on bulk print notices\nAbility to print items individually\nability to review all notices printed or in queue for different reasons\nAutomatic attachment of printed record to voter\nAbility to generate labels and shall be able to select if label includes\nVoter ID\nBarcode\nAbility to designate number of labels to be printed\nTechnical considerations:\nTechnical needs:\nBackend API for batch processing of queued notices and record logging.\nComprehensive database for correspondence storage and retrieval.\nScalable architecture to handle peak loads during election periods.\nPotential integration points:\nExisting election management systems for voter and candidate data synchronization.\nData storage and privacy considerations:\nSecure database for storing correspondence records and attachments.\nCompliance with relevant data protection regulations and statutes.\nScalability and performance requirements:\nEfficient handling of large data volumes with marginal latency issues.\nPotential technical challenges:\nEnsuring real-time processing and logging under heavy usage conditions.\nMaintaining data integrity across synchronized databases.\nDashboard Layout:\nThe\nCorrespondence Management Dashboard\nwill have three key areas:\nBuckets Area:\nDisplays queued correspondence organized into distinct buckets based on categories.\nSearch Area:\nAllows users to search for previously created correspondence using a variety of search fields.\nGrid Area:\nDisplays the results of the selected bucket or search with options to print, view, or remove items.\n1.\nBuckets Display:\nThe dashboard must only display buckets that contain queued correspondence ready for printing.\nIf no notices are present, the corresponding bucket should not appear.\nBucket Categories:\nVoter Registration:\nAcknowledgement Cards, Cancellations, NCOA (National Change of Address), Rejections, Other.\nElection:\nCandidate Forms, Polling Location Forms, Certificates of Election, Other.\nDistricts:\nPrecinct Change Notice, Polling Location Change Notice, District Change Notice.\n2.\nBucket Interaction:\nClicking a bucket will populate the grid with all queued items for that category.\nUsers can:\nReview individual items.\nPrint items individually.\nPrint all items in the bucket (batch print).\nUsers can remove a notice from the queue without printing by marking it as\n\"printed\"\nto allow for retrieval and reprinting in the future.\nOnce an item is printed, a copy of the printed correspondence will be automatically attached to the recipient\u2019s record (voter, candidate, elected official, etc.).\n3.\nBatch Print:\nUsers must be able to print all items displayed in the grid in a single batch operation.\nOnce printed, all items in the batch are removed from the queue.\nA copy of each printed item is automatically attached to the respective recipient\u2019s record.\n4.\nQueue Replenishment:\nAfter printing a batch or individual items, users should be able to:\nSelect a new batch of items to populate the grid.\nCancel and return to the previous screen.\n5.\nAd Hoc Reprinting:\nNotices removed from the queue must be flagged as\n\"printed\"\nand made available for reprinting from:\nThe recipient\u2019s profile, or\nThe correspondence module search.\nSearch Functionality:\nThe search area below the buckets must allow users to search for previously created correspondence using the following fields:\nMethod:\nMail, Email, MVP.\nStatus:\nSent, Queued, Canceled\nSent To:\nVoter, Candidate, Location, Elected Official, Poll Worker\nSent to ID:\nUnique identifier for the recipient\nCorrespondence Type:\nAcknowledgement, Confirmation, etc.\nDate Sent Beginning Range and Date Sent End Range\nButtons:\nSearch:\nExecutes the query based on search criteria.\nClear Fields:\nResets the search form.\nGrid Area:\nThe grid will display results from either bucket selections or search queries.

    "Description": "As a county election administrator,\nI need to define the order and details of an election event's contests and measures,\nSo that I can continue setting up my election.\nBallot order refers to the sequence in which candidates' names appear on the ballot during an election. This order can significantly impact election outcomes due to the \"ballot order effect,\" where candidates listed first may receive more votes simply because of their position\nWhy Ballot Order Exists\nMinimize Bias\n: To reduce any potential bias that might arise from the order in which candidates are listed. Some states use randomization to ensure fairness\nStandardization\n: To create a consistent and organized voting process. Different states have various methods for determining ballot order, such as alphabetical order, incumbency, or random selection\nVoter Convenience\n: To make it easier for voters to find and select their preferred candidates, especially in elections with many candidates\nMethods of Determining Ballot Order\nAlphabetical Order\n: Candidates are listed alphabetically by their last names.\nIncumbency\n: Incumbents may be listed first.\nRandomization\n: Names are listed in a random order, often determined by a lottery or drawing\nParty Affiliation\n: Candidates from the major parties might be listed first, followed by minor party and independent candidates\nA ballot rotation algorithm is a method used to vary the order of candidates' names on ballots across different precincts or districts. This ensures that each candidate appears in each position (first, second, third, etc.) an approximately equal number of times. The goal is to minimize any advantage that might come from being listed first, known as the \"ballot order effect\"\nHow It Works\nRandomization\n: The initial order of candidates is determined randomly.\nRotation\n: The order is then systematically rotated for each precinct or district. For example, if there are three candidates (A, B, and C), the order might be:\nPrecinct 1: A, B, C\nPrecinct 2: B, C, A\nPrecinct 3: C, A, B\nBenefits\nFairness\n: Ensures no candidate consistently benefits from being listed first.\nEqual Exposure\n: Gives all candidates an equal chance to be noticed by voters.\nSetting the \"Vote For\" value in a given contest within your election definition is crucial for several reasons:\nReasons to Set the \"Vote For\" Value\nClarity for Voters\n: It clearly indicates how many candidates a voter can select in a particular contest. For example, in a city council election where multiple seats are available, the \"Vote For\" value might be set to 3, allowing voters to choose up to three candidates.\nAccurate Ballot Design\n: Ensures that the ballot is designed correctly, reflecting the rules of the election. This helps prevent voter confusion and reduces the likelihood of errors, such as overvoting (selecting more candidates than allowed).\nCompliance with Election Laws\n: Adheres to legal requirements and election regulations, which often specify the number of candidates that can be voted for in different types of contests.\nEfficient Vote Counting\n: Facilitates accurate and efficient vote counting and tabulation. When the \"Vote For\" value is set correctly, it helps election officials quickly identify and address any issues with ballots that do not comply with the voting rules.\nTransparency and Fairness\n: Promotes transparency and fairness in the election process by ensuring that all candidates and voters understand the rules and that the election is conducted according to those rules.\nExample\nIn a school board election with five open seats, setting the \"Vote For\" value to 5 allows voters to select up to five candidates. This ensures that the election results accurately reflect the voters' preferences for all available positions.\nThe system must provide authorized users with a landing page where they can search the Election Contests currently assigned to the election in this Region, by the following parameters:\nContest Name\nDistrict Type\nDistrict Name\nThe system must provide the user with a results grid containing the following elements:\nAction menu (with View/Configure as actions)\nContest Name\nDistrict Name\nDistrict Type\nVote For\nRotation\nBallot Order",
    "Acceptance Criteria": "This module must allow the user to view and manage:\nThe contests and measures that will be included in this election event\nThe ballot order of those contests and measures\nThe rotation algorithm appropriate for each contest in the election event\nThe Ballot Vote-For for each contest in the election event\nThe ability to create new contests",

A Split Precinct is an easy way to identify different districts of the same district type that fall within the same precinct.\nAfter a precinct is created, the user will have the option to \"split\" it, which will create a copy of the precinct-to-district relationship of the now \"Parent\" precinct. This new precinct will not be able to be saved until it contains at least one unique district-to-precinct relationship as the Parent precinct, or any previously made splits from that parent.\nThere can only be one Parent Precinct. There is no limit on child precincts that can come from a parent.\nA precinct split is only used to determine an individual street segment\u2019s voting details. The Parent Precinct is what is used to determine the Polling Location and the smallest unit in which to tally ballot information from each district within the Parent Precinct.",

For example:\nThe first split will be auto-generated as the parent precinct name with \"1/1\" appended.\nThe second split will have \"2/2\" appended, and so on for each additional split.\nThe\nPrecinct-Split Code\nmust be editable and auto-generated as the parent precinct code with a two-digit numerical suffix reflective of the number of splits:\nThe first split will be auto-generated with \"01\" appended to the parent precinct code.\nThe second split will have \"02\" appended, and so on for each additional split.\nEach time a new split is added, all district assignments from the parent precinct (or the split precinct being further split) must be\nautomatically copied\nto the new split. Users can then modify the assignments as necessary.\nThe system must allow the user to search for and assign pre-existing street segments and districts to the precinct split.\nPrecinct Assignment\nThe system must provide a search function for users to find pre-existing street segments by address range, street name, or district.\nUsers must be able to select and assign these street segments and districts to the newly created precinct split.\nDistrict Assignment\n: The system must ensure that precinct-splits within a parent precinct have at least\none unique district assignment\n. However, multiple precinct splits within the same parent precinct will share other district assignments.\nStreet Segment Assignment\n: A street segment can only be assigned to\none precinct-split\n. If no precinct-split exists, the segment can only be assigned to the\nparent precinct\ndirectly.\nValidation\nThe system must validate that each street segment can only be assigned to a single precinct-split or parent precinct (if no splits exist).\nIt must ensure that precinct-splits within a parent precinct have at least one unique district assignment while allowing shared districts for other assignments.\nThe system must validate that the\nParent Precinct\nremains active and contains all district types that are distributed across the precinct splits. This means that the parent precinct should retain a summary or cumulative view of all districts assigned to its splits.\nThe system must prevent the creation of precinct splits without assigned street segments or districts.\nReporting\nThe system must generate reports showing which street segments and districts have been assigned to each precinct split.\nThe system must allow users to generate reports on:\nDistrict to Precinct Relationships\n: Showing which districts are assigned to which precincts and precinct splits.\nPrecinct to District Relationships\n: Showing all districts assigned to a specific precinct or precinct split.\nPrecinct Splits\n: Displaying all splits within a precinct and the associated districts and street segments.\nThe system should allow users to export precinct split data, district-to-precinct relationships, and precinct-to-district relationships in a CSV or PDF format.",

I then preceded to investigate why it was taking so long to get the information from api call GetLmsToDoList. Following the logic down to the database stored procedure [usp_Lobbyist_Registrant_Get_ImmediateToDoList] and running some performance test, I could tell that the stored proc was struggling to return results quickly. After spending three days trying to rewrite the procedure to get it to run faster, I am seeing no meaningful speed improvements. The main problem is that instead of creating [ToDoTask] (notifications) and saving it to the [ToDoTask_Table] most of the [ToDoTask] 's are being calculated every time someone reloads the home page which causes really bad performance. There are 16 ToDoTask categories as of the time of this writing and a lot of the work to fix this in LRS is already in place. There is a table in the database called [ToDoTask] for storing this information with type codes and subtype codes [ToDoTaskType] and [ToDoTaskSubType]. Most of this seams to be done in CFIS but not in LRS. Two categories seem to already be working in LRS, Client Authorized Lobbyist & Client Denied Lobbyist notifications. I will list out required stories to fix the other categories.",

However, only one of the three voter records below shows a temp staff\u2019s name in the audit log if the reason was VH. No\nvoter history, absentee or petition activity shows on their records either.\nOr maybe staff performed a voter contact update and did not scan a support doc even though it changed the voter\u2019s Status/Condition Code but again, no Change Audit History for 11/7/20 except the 1st voter listed below.\nAll three voters listed below have these things in common:\nSteven Niven in the Audit Log on 11/25/19 which I assume was related to A/LM in 2019.\nAll show a Status/Condition Code date of 11/07/20 and a Last Contact Date of 11/03/20.\nNo supporting document to show how the voter went from A/LM to A/RG.\nNone of the voters have voter history, petition or absentee activity on their record in 2020.\n1st Voter:\nVN 11612942 (Christopher Derr) does show Change Audit History for SRuiz performing a change on 11/7/20 but again, no support document.\n2nd Voter:\nVN 12933789 (Jenny Christensen) no Change Audit History in 2020 to support the status/cond.

(example file attached)\nFiler has immediate to dos to update contributor info, however the immediate to dos should not have been created. States Business Type needs populating.\nHere you can see Business Type is already populated.\n@Julie Spencer\nprovided the following additional information on this issue.\nThe step of the import process which creates the ToDoTask does not have the correct logic. The stored procedure being used\nusp_Import_Insert_ToDoTask_Contributor calls the function ToDoTask_Contribution_AggregationAmount and in that function it is joining with the Member table to get the contributor's record and determining if it has the OccupationCode when the contributor is and Individual or that it has a BusinessTypeCode when it a different type of contributor. That would be good except it finds a record for (in our example) AFT New Mexico where the BusinessTypeCode is NULL; however, that was the first version of the contributor and not the most recent version. The function ToDoTask_Contribution_AggregationAmount needs to be updated to only look at the most recent version of the contributor record and then determine if OccupationCode or BusinessTypeCode is not there.",
    "Resolution": "After talking with\n@Rick Petrecca\n, it was determined that only IND, COM, CMT and OTH types should enfore the Business Type limit, and the message should only show for those contributor types. CMT is not currently used in NM, but I kept it in the UI check for consistency with the stored procedure that also contains CMT. The error message should be different for IND types, and CAN, LOB, SELF, and PTY types should not display or message nor should they create a to-do item.\nI've also updated the Save feature of the modal to only make the ToDo item go away when the issue has actually been fulfilled. Previously, the ToDo item would go away with any update that happened on the Contributor Update modal, regardless of whether the ToDo item had been fulfilled.",

However, it gave the report an End of Reporting Period of 5/27/24 and a Due Date of 5/30/24. This matches the Reporting Period set up in the threshold, but not my expectation of how supplemental reports should be working. My expectation is that, since a report is due within 3 days of making the IE, the end date of the report added when crossing the threshold should be the date of the transaction that exceeded the threshold and the due date 3 days after that. This would be consistent with the client's reporting requirements for IEs. Any subsequent IEs dated after the one triggering the report would trigger an additional IE Report (or 24-hour IE Report) based on the newly added IE.

Is still showing as $500.\n3) Do not delete any new transactions yet to be filed for the reporting period.\nI added a new transaction of each type, while the report was filed, then I unfiled the report, and all the new transactions remained, and were picked up the next time I filed the report.\nI noticed that in the case of amended reports, the unfiling process was not always unfiling the correct transactions. In order to fix this, I had to change the way RecountVersionID was being populated in the Transactions table. I have attached the correction script to change the current data so that the RecountVersionID in the Transactions table is always the version of the report that the transaction was initially filed on. (The RecountVersionID in the TransactionReports table is unchanged and continues to be handled differently than in the Transactions table). I also had to change the filing process and the auto amend process to populate this field correctly in the Transactions table.",

    "Repro Steps": "AC -\nAs a user, I would like to see the timing of the calls to Livecheck to be limited and the frequency of these calls to be decreased, so the number of calls to SSA will not be inflated.\nCall Frequency Adjustment:\nWe propose changing the frequency of our system's batches of calls to DPS from every 2 minutes to every 30 minutes.\nOperational Hours:\nCurrently, the process operates continuously. We suggest restricting call times to 6AM-10PM CST.\nCopied from Description when changed from Issue to Bug\nI received an escalation call from Kristi regarding an issue\nthat had come up earlier this week. The Social Security Administration is\nclaiming that TX is hitting their HAVV (Help America Vote Verification) system\nwith hundreds of thousands of hits per week. Our TEAM system sends SSN\nverifications to DPS, which get passed through to AAMVA to then hit HAVV and then\nback to us.\nTeja pulled data that showed out system running Live Check (our\nsystem SSN call) for an average of ~2,000 hit per week over the last 15 weeks. This\nis what Kristi expected and is in line with their volume of voters\nprocessed.\nHAVV shows TX hitting that system\nfor upwards of 200+k call per week over the last several weeks. In fact they\npublish the data online (\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/open/havv/havv-weekly-2024-03-30.html\n).\nSo something doesn\u2019t add up. DPS has a\nteam of technical people working to verify their system is not causing the elevated\nnumbers and have insisted that they only pass our calls through to HAVV. They insist\nit has to be traffic coming from us.

This will show their voter history on their record (it will not have their district number or sequence saved), and they will not appear on the Early Vote Report\nNotes from AK:\nWhile in the screen processing a voter, after the election worker saves the record, the pop-up displays accordingly stating it was successful and two (2) was assigned as the sequence number in the Seq # field and the certificate populated as a PDF upon request.\nAfter I selected OK to the successful pop-up, I then wanted to leave the module and I selected the hamburger and received the pop-up warning stating to save or cancel the ballot. I had already saved the ballot, and in this module, there isn\u2019t a cancel button. This same pop-up also displays when you select the Logout option. The real issue is if they improperly log out by closing the browser using the X, which I did. If this happens, the system will cancel the saved early vote record (NOTE: This does appear to be intermittent as I have had some cancel and some that did not while testing this issue).\nWhen you view the voter\u2019s record in Inquiry, the voter will have voter history on their record, but they will not appear on the Early Vote report.\nAnd, when you go back into the Early Vote module and look them up again, you will receive the pop-up stating the voter has already voted. The system is properly looking at the voter history which is still on the voter\u2019s record. However, the district number and the sequence number are no longer assigned to this voting record.\nIf you select the OK button displayed in the already voted pop-up, the system is unfortunately allowing the user to add a district in the District field and to save the record again obtaining a second sequence number.\nWhen you order the Early Vote report, it now shows sequence 1 and 3 but, nothing about sequence 2 which can be rather confusing to staff when trying to do accountability\nIn addition, this voter NOW has two lines of voter history recorded on their voting record\nThe proper way for a sequence number to be removed from a voter record is to delete it using the trash can in the Action box. In this scenario, when it is deleted, the voter history is removed from the voter\u2019s record, and it will appear on the reports as deleted.

It is not showing the 3 dots for Kanawha to delete on their end. If possible, can this be prioritized so long as your team is not tied up with major fixes/work at the moment?

Isaiah McCoy \u2013 a Kanawha Voter \u2013 called to verify his registration. I found that Marshall had mistakenly pulled him over during an OVR registration. They were trying to register a Rece McCoy but pulled Isaiah instead. They should have registered him as a \u201cnew\u201d voter instead of a \u201cchange voter.\u201d\nI let Isaiah know we\u2019re on it, and he is prepared to vote on Tuesday.\nAs normal procedure, I instructed Kanawha (Greg) to pull him back since he was duly registered before the deadline, back date the change, and he will make sure he appears in the Election Day books they are printing before Tuesday. But prior to pulling the record, we noticed that the real Rece McCoy already voted in Marshall County in person. Therefore, voter record 100862471 shows Marshall participation. And Isaiah McCoy (who the real record should belong to) should not have history yet, as he plans to vote on Election Day. So if we pulled him over now\u2026 It\u2019d show double participation when it should not, since these are 2 different people.\nI\u2019m thinking we have Marshall delete the early voting history on the record for Rece, and then re-add him via OVR, and re-credit him for early voting. Then, have Kanawha pull the record back to reflect Isaiah\u2019s information, and credit him when (or if) he votes next week.

Mr Barbalace received one of her notices. He called to tell her he is no longer associated with the Committee (Political Party Committee) Saco Democratic City Committee ID 2155. He was on the Admin Report - Organization Contact Information\nIn PROD as of 6/3/2024 - User Administration, his Account Status was showing as Inactive, but his Officer Status is still showing as Active. I updated his Account Status and checked the LOCKED checkbox on his Account Status as well, so he is now Inactive and LOCKED, however his Officer Status is still showing as Active. I don't have a way to change that. Normal system behavior would be when a Registration is updated, and a Officer is removed then updated with a new officer, the User Account Status would still show as Active, but the Officer Status would be showing as Inactive.\nNot sure how they got the officer Status to show Active, but the officer is not an active officer of the committee anymore.\nLooking at this again on Monday June 3, 2024. User Account Status is showing as just LOCKED, but Officer Status is still showing as Active. They must have changed something again!\nBoth User Account Status and Officers Status need to be updated to Inactive.\nAdmin Report - Contact List - Committee\nAdmin Report - Organization Contact Information\nReport is using Election Cycle for Election Year criteria.\nThis Report is showing Mr Barbalance,'s Officer Status as\nInactive.\nSo we have a mismatch somewhere or the Admin Report is pulling User Account Status instead\nThe Officer Status for Kenneth Barbalace in User Administration is showing as Active, His User Account Status is just showing as Locked. The Locked is correct, the User Admin page itself shows he has never logged in, but I think the Grid should show Inactive and Locked both.\nBoth the Inactive and Locked flags on the User Admin Page are showing as checked.\nIn UAT - Using the same committee 2155 - I filed a Committee Registration Amendment on 5/31/2024.\nI removed the old Treasurer Bruce Martel and added a new one Lisa McCreary.\nIt looked like it worked correctly.\nIn UAT - working\nas an Admin Register a Party Committee.

Org list is not showing Lisa McCreary, but is showing Inactive Treasurer Karen Waddell.\nWhen a Treasurer is updated in the system, their\nUser Account Status\nremains Active, but their Officer Status is updated to Inactive.\nNot sure how Maine got Barbalance Officer Status to show as ACTIVE, should be showing as Inactive, since he's no longer a officer for that committee.\n.",

However, if we file the transfer of the laptop in the 2024 filing period (outside amend transactions) the function works correctly, and it would become a fixed asset.

The design on the FDS module does not include managing notification batches, so the expectation is that notifications should go out without user intervention as configured in the notification templates contained in the notification schedules. In particular, two schedules should be working - \"Notifications\" tied to the filing cycle start date, and \"Filing Notices\" tied to the report due dates.\nFor the \"Notifications\" schedule tied to the filing cycle, NM expects to be able to send out a notification to all\nactive\nfilers that are enrolled in a particular cycle X days after the start date of that cycle. This will be used to notify filers that a new cycle will be starting and there will be new filing obligations for the upcoming cycle. This will be sent out late in the current cycle, 300+ days after the cycle start date.\nFor the \"Filing Notices\" tied to filing obligations, NM expects to be able to send out courtesy notices to active filers who have an upcoming, unfiled report as well as late notices to active filers who have a past due report yet to file.\nMonday item:\nhttps://gocivix.monday.com/boards/742061987/pulses/6119860984",

I ran this twice to make sure I was not doing something wrong (I chose the 2024 Primary and UOCAVA) and got the same 391 result both times, as if it was retrieving all absentees from the 2024P.\nIf you have reports on your end that can help determine where the discrepancies are, that would be great. The only two types of voter history that our office entered manually was the absentees and the provisionals. We cannot run a report out of SVRS that queries just on if it was a provisional ballot or not. If you can run a report of provisional voter history status (counted and not counted), then we can audit against our provisionals. Our absentees are one off, which I will try and see if we can determine who that is.

The DFA tried a second time to correct things and the same thing happened.\nBrett, Cathy, and I initially didn\u2019t understand what steps the DFA had taken as the DFA hadn\u2019t originally sent us a screen print of the application error. We decided to try and duplicate the potential issue using Sandbox before calling the DFA back. We entered an LLC contribution with the incorrect date and then used the Update link to correct the date and it worked as expected (changed the date and generated an MC rpt.). We then entered a second LLC contribution with an incorrect date and instead of using the Update link, we used the Delete link and then re-entered with the correct date and Sandbox worked as expected \u2013 generating an MC report.\nNext, we called the DFA and asked what steps they used to try and correct the data entry error and they walked us through their steps which was using the Update link to get back into the transaction and change the date and save the update. When they did this, they said they received an application error. At that point we asked the DFA to send us a screen print and we asked if they would okay with CPF staff trying to use the Update link a make the correction. The DFA gave authorization and Cathy attempted to do this, and she received the same error the DFA did.\nSo, I\u2019m not sure why production is producing an application error in this process. And I\u2019m not sure why CPF staff got different results in Sandbox and Production.",

When the report is FILED, it is showing up on the Filed Reports, page as filed, but it is showing up on the Home page under the Immediate to Do list, as not being filed, and the option to FILE the report is still there. I worked with Sean and Parker on this for a while, Parker needs to do some investigation on what is going on. It doesn't seem to be anything that has to do with Sean's bug fix, but this is\nNOT happening in PROD! It's going back to Sean, but it's not longer a Critical Issue.

Check in the Statement with the original File Date of 4/12/2024, then click RESUME, and the Filer Details Information is there, I filed the report - receive the verification that the report has been filed, but when you look on the Immediate To Do - The statement shows as Not Filed, and it is showing as LATE.

Some of the by mail (M) type didn\u2019t have an absentee by mail application date or sent date but I logged them as an M type anyway. The seq. worked when I logged the M type who had a sent date and app date and the (M) type for those that didn\u2019t have a sent or app date. The first Seq 7 (M) type is an example of a record that had an app and sent date for the (M) type.\nThe Absentee Review Board report does not show all of the voters who were logged.

If I'm wrong, let me know, and I'll delete this note!\n1. Name Reservation (Wild Rock Excavation 14501895) was created on 9/19/24. I can see the details in Filing History, but when I go to Correspondence History for this entity, it's blank, so I can't see what was emailed to him. But he's attempting to use the reservation code he received and it's not working.\nEntity Information:\nFiling History:\nCorrespondence History:\nError when attempting to use Release Code\n2. Additional issue:\nThe name reservation was for an internal review item for \"better networks\" (work order number W2024100338413). When I went in to process the work order, the name disappeared. I approved it and it appeared to process, however, the approved name reservation is not showing up (no entity was created).\n3. DBA registration inhouse when customer reserves name online\nThis Name Reservation code pulled up two names when entering the release code in. Name was for Simple Touch Nails by Monica (business name reservation #14502811). After approving a DBA with a Name Reservation code entered, the acknowledgement and file stamp refers to entity #14187830, which cannot be found in the system. I have attached a copy of the approved filing documentation. (Cherie's note: I have asked Mandeep to add the entity number to this entity - but we need to make sure to fix the problem... if a reservation ID is entered in the Name Availability step, they should be able to select the correct one, and the DBA created should also save the entity ID+UTC number in the system).\nAfter discussion with Mandeep, we identified that the stamped file copy is pulling the number from the BusinessId field for these instead of from the EntityNumber field, and it's not saving to the EntityNumber field, only the the EntityNumberWithUTC field (it's possible this is being caused from force approving these work orders?).\nAdditional DBAs with this same issue:\nSound Brew Coffee (W2024102279280)\nHaus of Grace & Glow (W20241106114633)\nThis is how it saved:\nSame thing happened with Sound Brew Coffee\n4.

When you hit continue, everything saves except the City, which goes back to blank. (tested with entity 14504572-0160)\nAlso happening with 84107 - it will not allow Murray to be selected (only allowing Millcreek)",

    "Description": "Below is the email from Tarrant that I mentioned in this morning\u2019s call I was going to send to you and open ticket.\nHere are their comments: PLEASE provide ANSWERS.\nOn 10/24, there were two files uploaded between the 9:10 and 12:17 times shown in the screenshots:\nTarrant checked both files (along with several files all the way back to 10/18) and\nonly found the voters in one file )vru_20241024_1 file\n).\nEach\none of the voters had 1 row in that file uploaded to TEAM, and all 3\nhad an Event Type, which tells TEAM to send a new voter in Pending\nstatus back through Live Check to be re-evaluated and activated.\nTarrant\nsays they see no reason why an event would have occurred at 9:10 from\nthe files shown above - and definitely no Event Type 1's, which tell\nTEAM to create a new voter.\nThe\nfile TEAM sent back only included the 2 active voters (using an Event\nType 99 - which activates the voters). Reyes was not in the response\nfile, so he didn't get activated.\nThe\nonly difference Tarrant sees between the 3 voters is that Reyes\nresponded to an incomplete notice and was sent back to TEAM once before\nhe was sent back in this most recent file. The other two were only sent\nback to TEAM in this most recent file.\nTarrant wants to know\nwhere the 9:10pm events came from\nand\nwhy Mr. Reyes has not be returned in a response file\n.",

This happened previously, and we thought it was a one-off with the one work order, but it has been happening again with additional work orders. With that one, we thought that it was not the size of the image causing the issue, because it was only a single page, but after additional research, I believe it was a file size issue because of how the image was being saved (see additional info below)\nPer client: I think I figured out what was happening. When the doc was saved from customers email we saved it via Save as PDF which it did have the whole doc but when I printed the doc that was saved/uploaded it printed really big. So I saved the doc as a Microsoft Print to PDF from customers email as Fit to Paper. I attached and it opened the image in the work order and it let me process it. I have attached what printed when I printed the image.\nThis happened on another work order. The customer sent over the two files highlighted, and they are the ones that were causing the issue. \"File 3\" was the one that was saved differently, and it worked fine. I believe this is a file size issue based on how the files are saved. We may need to limit the size of uploaded files, so these massive ones can't be uploaded (online is limited to 4MB, but inhouse doesn't appear to be limited)\n--> I used these files to replicate the issue in QA with this work order number: W2025010210486",

    "Description": "Issue: VR batches are attaching the documents, but not attaching the signatures\nNotes from AK:\nI created a couple of VR batches and noticed that it\u2019s not catching signatures. I tried several different types of VR batches, but none of them seem to have worked \u2013 FCD, DMVP, OTH. It\u2019s doing the same thing that it did with the Question floppies. It will attach the document, but not the signature. There have been a few other times recently that I\u2019ve noticed documents that were attached without signatures, so I thought VREMS might be having issues with attaching signatures in general.\nAfter my brain was refreshed, it seems it is likely that it is the setting on your scanner \u2013 something must have been changed, it is not a VREM issue. The settings in VREMS capture the signatures and are universal for all users. At some point, all of the scanners have been set to capture correctly, so something must have changed on your end. We have had no other reports.\nBelow is an example of the VREMS settings for the FCD. If you are still having issues, you may want to get someone from George\u2019s group (Wyatt?) to help you.\nHOWEVER, this particular example shows that FCD does NOT capture both the card and the signature. So this must not be normal for this kind of document. See the example after this for the DMVP (CO3).\nTyler from IT came out and checked our computers/scanners today. He thinks this is a VREMS issue.\nWe can get signatures to scan to the record if we upload them as support docs, but not VR batches.\nWe just walked through this with Heather and it is capturing the signature and uploading, but when going to the voter record the signature record is not available in Display Signature. The Reg doc is available in Display Document, but no signature in Display Signature. This is happening with all types of manual batching.\nPhillip says the application is putting a NULL in the VOTER ID for the signature.",

The logic seems to take the current county registration of the voter into the reports, rather than the current county poll place they voted in. So, if they voted in Barbour county and moved to Tucker county, they will show up in tucker county's early voting report with the Barbour county poll place, which increases the total count by that one voter.\nThere is, also 2 more voters in this report that is unaccounted for.

    "Description": "County Name: GALVESTON\nDate of Report:\n2/13/25\nIssue Summary:\nReports do not match in regards to total voters assigned to specific districts.\nDescription of the Issue:\nCounty is a split county and the elections office assigned the\ndistrict U.S. Congress 14 to pull all the voters into their local\nelection. The reason they did that is because the county did not have\nthe Countywide district assigned to all streets. The voter\nregistration office then assigned all streets to the countywide\ndistrict. They noticed that the total of U.S. Congress 14 district\nand Countywide district total did not match.\nDetails:\nBelow is the total of voters assigned to each district. The districts that the Voter registrar is asking about are as follows.\nCounty states that all four districts should all match to 240,330.\nShe states that she assigned all the street to Countywide ALL, Court of Appeals, and Criminal district Attorney.\nPreliminary Research Conducted:\nGalveston\nran a voter list, street list, and district list to investigate why\nthere is a difference and what streets are missing the three other\ndistricts.\nStreet List Report #001192689\nis\nfor U.S. Congress 14. There is a total of 11,854 streets assigned\nto that district. On the same report, I filtered out Countywide\ndistrict code ALL and there are no blanks meaning that district is\nalso assigned to all 11,854. To double check that is accurate, I\nran another street list report ID 00192693 that I selected for\nCTY-ALL. Same result. The district is assigned to 11,854 streets as\nwell. Meaning that countywide district, court of appeals and criminal\ndistrict attorney should also have 240,330 voters but they don\u2019t.\nAnother\nstreet list report was ran to check if Countywide district was\nNOT assigned to a street. The report came back with only two\nstreets not having that district assigned. Missing Streets and Out\nof County Street. Which is correct.\nOn the\nscreenshot above it does show to be that there is a difference of\nassigned precincts on the US Congress compared to the other three\ndistricts.\nThose precincts are 232.1; 419.1; 432.2; 480.1\nI ran a\nvoter list report #001192787\nand there was no data found. Meaning there are no assigned voters to those precincts.\nVoter list report #001192727\nis\nfiltered out to see if there are any blanks on the three other\ndistricts. When the Countywide ALL district is filtered out, there\nare blanks but there shouldn\u2019t be because according to the street\nreport all four districts are assigned to all streets.\nHere is an example. Column AZ for Countywide ALL was filtered for\nblanks. Then I copy and pasted a VUID into TEAM voter inquiry. The\ndisplay of districts showcases that\nINDEED\nthe district is assigned but the report is showing it isn\u2019t.\nTHE MAIN CONCERN OF THE COUNTY IS THAT WHY IS IT SHOWING ON THE VOTER\u2019S\nSTREET AND VOTER INQUIRY BUT NOT ON THE VOTER LIST REPORT AND WHEN\nRUNNING THE DISTRICT LIST REPORT.",

Either creating a new segment or updating existing\nstreet segments.\nI think clerks would like to do such activities by\nthemselves rather than coming to us. There are two solutions for the two\nproblems:\nThere\nare Orphan streets that are not linked to any street segments. Such\nstreets exist in the street library but have no associated street segment,\nand are not visible to users in the application.\nBut when users try to create a street segment using those streets, they will\nget error saying that the street segment already exists in the system.\nSo, the solution is just removing those streets. We\nhave tested this in lower system long time ago but haven\u2019t yet pushed to prod.\nI have attached list of orphan streets that needs\nto be deleted, please review and approve the delete. (if you need, we can keep\nthe backup in the database to be safe)\nThe\napplication should allow users to update street segment if there is no\nvoter on the segment. I think we can even allow changes to high & low\nvalues to existing street segment as far as the change doesn\u2019t conflict\nwith existing voter on the segment.\nSince I have been doing this for long as a data\nfix, I don\u2019t see any risk if a user can also make such changes through the\napplication. If you agree with this move, we will have a code fix.\nLet me know if you have any question or concern.\nThanks,\nBiruk Keraga\nData Developer\n1 Easton Oval, Ste. 320\nColumbus, OH 43219\nGoCivix.com",

The examples she provided are 100321341, 000748342, 000390976. The \u201cYES\u201d indicators in the counted column are correct, but she indicated that there is no way that these folks have voted multiple times, and it never counted.\nI checked my own record, as I have never been issued a provisional ballot, so I\u2019m certain all columns should read \u201cYES.\u201d If you could please take a look at mine (ID 100596405), that would be great. The trend I\u2019m seeing is that the Counted column is correct from the 2022 Primary forward. Anything from the 2020 General to the 2016 Primary for me shows that the ballots were not counted. The username \u201cENETCONV\u201d is all associated with the \u201cNO\u201d columns.\nAnother example I found was voter 000273186. Her provisional WAS counted, per our provisional ballot tracker and the ad hoc report. But the UI does not show that A) she was ever a provisional voter or B) that her vote was counted.\nThere was a related issue to the counted column previously, but it was supposed to be resolved:https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/753893993/pulses/7863664628.

So the Expiration Date year should be 3 years after their renewal date (if they renewed in our system). If they did not renew in our system, we may not have the details of when they last renewed, but the Expiration Date year should be a multiple of 3 years after their formation date (3, 6, 9, 12, etc)\nDomestic General Partnerships have a 5-year renewal window.
