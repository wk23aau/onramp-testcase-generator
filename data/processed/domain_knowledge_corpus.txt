In Miami, new lobbyist have 60 days to complete training after registering as a lobbyist. If they do not complete the training, they are frozen and need to have their accounts locked from filing/interacting with new principals.
For existing lobbyist, the training is good for 2 years. They must renew on or before 2 years, or they also will go into frozen status and need to have their account frozen. Right now we need to work out if this looks like some kind of api connection with the training portal or some other manual process.

In Miami, lobbyist will need to pay 100 dollars to complete their training certificate required by local law. This bucket of transactions will need to be kept separate from the registration fee, which are a yearly 490 fee. This is due to internal Miami policy dictating the handling of funds.
They
want to lock lobbyist accounts registered after 60 days if they do not complete
the training

In Miami, Lobbyist are required to take training within
60 days of registration
. Upon completion, the certificate lasts for 2 years, after which certification will need to be completed again.
Within our application, we need a new field to track Days remaining before expiration to we can show who is due for training. Miami will use this to deactivate users who fail to recertify their training.
Data Conversion was agreed upon per contract amendment in Feb*.
Depending upon the data conversion decision,
we will need to bring in existing users who may have some days left before they need to recertify. We will need a path during registration or otherwise to identify these folks and populate their days left.
Updated 3/29/2024
Data Conversion will need to include users who have completed training in the past two years. Data provided by client, will include:
Training date
Expiration Date
We'll need a way a way to repeat the cycle, where a user must
restart the 60 day count down and require the lobbyist to pay, and rewatch provided training.
Miami-Dade will also require a report that allows admin user to review Lobbyist that are not in compliance.
Potentially via Ad Hoc Query tool with modification
Users who fail to comply with training requirements, will have their accounts
frozen
(definitely not suspended*) by the system until training requirements are satisfied.

Lobbyist Client Form
- necessary updates
5% holding section
-> move onto civix form
Lobbyist connections
-> add to civix forms
Lobbyist phone ->
add to cvx forms
Date employed - add
to cvx forms

Expenditure Type prob need to be removed as they don't get that granular.
Expenditure Report for Each client
Nothing captured as part of the expenditure report
regarding what it is being spent on.
So we want to break it down based on expenditures

For the Lobbyist registration export, we will need to
include the Principal name associated to the lobbyist.

Lobbyist Client export -> hide compliance status,
contributions and expenditures, business interests
List lobbyist names instead of number of lobbyists
Add
column for registration date on the lobbyist index export file

Clients and Lobbyists will both need to display what
they're lobbying on (the issue) in the registration. We can capture this when they authorize, but we need a place to display it publicly and with historical version (along w the dates it was updated)

End
of the year - they don’t want people not registered into the current year to be
able to register until after jan1.

If an existing lobbyist does not complete renewal by Jan 15, all of their previous years connections to Principals shall be severed and they will need to reestablish their connections.
If
jan 15 passes, and they don’t renew but don't withdraw, they are considered
inactive

Lobbyist must be able to terminate for a single or multiple principals and then file their
expenditure report. Would like to remind them on termination that they still
need to file the report for terminated principals.
Help
language during the terminate process to let them know they still need file on

The tool offers timely, proactive
notices, reminders of upcoming events and verifications that the voter has properly
completed a step in the election process. The notices anticipate the voter needs
based on the voter record, time of year, and where the state is in their election cycle.
These notice will be offered in an omni-channel format, with voters selecting the
format and frequency in which they would like to be notified. Whether that be
through a chatbot on a smart speaker, via text message, email or automated phone
call, the purpose of these proactive notices is to help the voter get the information
they need, when they need it, in the way they wish to receive it. IVIS will provide you
accurate information regarding the election process that can be integrated into your
favorite social media channels. The tool will allow you to push notifications through
your favorite social media channels so you don’t need to download a new app. The
text originating from the election official and from social media and these message
will provide a link to the proper front door. For current voters, the text would pull
the voter into the election authority website for their registered location. For new
voters, they will be asked to enter their state and county so the system will know
their proper election authority. The type of notification a voter gets will be
dependent on their status as a voter or non-voter. Ask for one piece of information
at a time and each time, offers back information. Non-registered voter profile –
pulling in information from current voter profile and creating a non-registered voter
profile. The non-voter profile based on name, DOB and county where of your
permanent address. To sign-up to get notifications about the election process,
residents can visit either the State or County Election websites, via text, via email,
social media, chatbot skill - robocalls
The type of notices will be curated based on the format chosen – for instance email,
texts, etc. can be more personalized, whereas social media notices will provide more
general information about deadlines pull users into the website they need to visit to
register/etc.

Provides a feature that allows users to search site content and displays results in a consumable manner.
The Problem:
Election information can be difficult to categorize. Many users visit the public site are simply looking for items such as upcoming elections and who is on the ballot, all of which is accessible without logging in. Other areas such as contact, where to register, etc should all be made accessible via an easy to user search tool.

The chatbot will provide automated user assistance with challenges they face using MVP. The chatbot will provide contextual help to the user.
The Problem:
Users call the county or state for assistance. The county/state struggles to efficiently help the user because they are unable to tell where the user is at in the system. Additionally, users are only able to get answers to common questions during office hours. Still need to measure the time chatting for a quick answer vs. calling a county worker, though based on assumption there would be time savings.

Voice led experience allows the user to make changes to their voting record using a smart speaker such as Amazon's echo or Google assistant.

MVP should offer the ability for the end-user to interact with MVP in a State approved language such as Spanish and English.
The Problem:
Many RFPs and states have requested language translations to offer constituents this request is likely a result of the voting rights act. "The number of places required to provide multilingual ballots and other election materials is determined by the Census Bureau every five years. In December 2016, 263 jurisdictions in 29 states were subject to the requirement."

The MVP site should allow an Admin portal that will allow Admin users to change content as well as manage notification settings.
The problem:
The current Indiana portal allows Admin users to change content on certain parts of the site. This was created to solve the problem of content changes taking too long to go through development. States have different language that should appear on the site as well as differing notification preferences.

The Problem:
More users have been accessing MVP on their mobile devices over the last couple of years. The current application makes it difficult for users to complete tasks. The UI has become cluttered due to added features without additional feedback or user experience input.

The voter registration business rules will remain intact, however additional features will be added to allow for additional registration paths. The voter registration screens will change to a more mobile friendly view.
The Problem:
The registration path often presents users with too much information and is not suitable for mobile views. Additionally, paths that offer the ability for those serving in the armed forces and living overseas are missing.
For instance, many States accept Federal Postcard Application (FPCA) for military and individuals living overseas to vote, however the current version of MVP does not support this feature. We've seen this feature request in RFPs for the Washington and Arizona state.

Personalized experience that caters to first time voters providing them with the necessary information to feel confident in voting.
The Problem:
Many First Time Voters are unsure of the election process and receive most of their information from unreliable sources. Election officials feel that this leads to mistrust of the election process. The current solution does not provide any educational tools or prompts for first time voters.

The goal is to have early voting locations totals for
epollbook users.
Currently, those that use SVRS rather than epollbooks for
early voting use the report from the following ticket to reconcile their early
voting totals by location:
https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/753893993/pulses/2599272235
.
Epollbook users
need this report as well. For this to occur, we need the early voting location
for each voter record included on the epollbook voter history import file
(ES&S), and we would then need SVRS to save that location with each voter
history record that is imported (CIVIX).
Please add this
as a ticket, but it is not a priority for the 2022 General.
Thank you,
Ad hoc Query

When a lobbyist is registering, they select an employer. At times, the lobbyist cannot find the desired lobbyist employer. This feature contains the functionality for when that scenario occurs.
A lobbyist is searching for employers during registration and they cannot find the desired employer. The lobbyist enters the employer name and the email. They also add relationship information. When they send the registration request email, a token is created that contains the information about the lobbyist and the relationship.
The employer receives the email containing the token. They have two options:
1) register as an employer and use the token to create and authorize the relationship.
2) The employer is already registered. They log into their workspace and use the token to create and authorize the relationship.
Admin user has the ability to configure the content of the registration request email that goes out to the employer.
Admin users must approve all new registrations. If an employer who has used a token is rejected by the admin user, a warning is displayed to the admin user that an employer is being rejected who already has an authorized lobbyist relationship. The admin user can use the ad hoc notification to notify the lobbyist that the lobbyist employer relationship is being deleted because the employer registration has been rejected.

The admin user can use the ad hoc notification to notify the lobbyist that the lobbyist employer relationship is being deleted because the employer registration has been rejected.

As an filer
I want to receive text message updates regarding my filing and registration
So that I can be reminded of important deadlines and tasks required of my committee.
Messages may go to a single filer, all filers, or specific filer groups.
Alabama SOS Staff choosing message recipients will function similar to e-mail message capability.
Message sending will be limited to Alabama SOS Staff and will not be extended to localities or filers.
Messages will be limited to 140 characters per single text.
Messages may be pre-developed or ad-hoc.
Civix will get a Short Code (abbreviated phone number of 5 or 6 digits in length) that will be assigned to Alabama Secretary of State’s office, and messages from AL SOS will have this code shown as their origination.
Each message will incur a fee, which will pass through Civix to our SMS provider. Civix uses a 3
rd
party to send messages as they manage opt outs, message de-duplication, message analytics, adherence to rules and regulations for different regions and countries as well as the telecom service.

To enable Miami-Dade user the ability to utilize the system, and ensure base functionality is working, the ethics dev team will need to update components and modules to match the requirements of Miami-Dade clients.

Provides the functionality found in the lobbyist workspace that is unique to the lobbyist.

Miami Dade will need integration with the training module (and payment for said training) so users can watch a video and complete their statutory training requirements.
Lobbyist must complete training within 60 days of registration and then every 2 years after initial completion.
System needs to provide a link to the training resource
System should provide a link to pay for the training to the filer
System should be able to keep track of who has completed training
Jacob has completed this portion as work in the DB.
#61763
Miami would like the system to automatically lockout folks who have not met the training requirements
Todo is created to let filer know they need to complete training
Address while lobbying (hide) from lobbyist details
Show training status and date of last training on lobbyist details screen.
Add link to training on the lobbyist details screen.
Training money and registration money need to remain separate from accounting perspective (per Susannah)

LD 1590 - Change Request Details
to add Original Source Reporting
Summary:
If LD 1590
passes, the Commission would need to offer via it’s eFiling website a method
for PAC and party committee filers to add original source contributors to their
regularly scheduled campaign finance reports. The original source contributors
and their contributions
cannot
affect the cash balance of the
committees and are for display disclosure only.
Specific Requirements:
1.
New Schedule on CFRs
If an Original Source contribution has been entered,
CFRs must include a new filing schedule, Schedule A-2, to display the Original
Source contribution
2.
New Contribution sub-category &
functionality
When a committee is entering a new Contribution,
from the Contribution Type menu, there will be an option to select ‘Original
Source’
When
Contribution Type: Original Source is selected, the fields for Amount, Date,
and Description will continue to get pushed down until appropriately placed
under an Original Contributor entry
When
Contribution Type: Original Source is selected, the Funding Source menu will
have ‘Contributors donating more than $10,000’ as the only option
When Funding Source Contributors Donating More
than $10,000 is selected, a new field titled ‘Applicable Contributors’ appears,
and when clicked, displays a menu listing all contributors whose contributions
aggregate to more than $10,000 in an election cycle
When an Applicable Contributor is selected, a field
titled ‘Original Contributor Type’ appears, and when clicked, displays a menu
listing: Individual, Commercial Source, Political Party Committee, Political
Action Committee, Ballot Question Committee, and Nonprofit Organization
Like
in current functionality, the site allows selection from currently registered
Political Party Committees, Political Action Committees, and Ballot Question
Committees if one of those Original Contributor Types is chosen
Like in current functionality, the site either
matches entry with pre-entered Contributors, respective to type (e.g.,
Individual or Commercial Source), or offers ‘+ Add a New Contributor’ with all
currently offered fields depending on type (e.g., has fields for Occupation and
Employer for Individuals)
Once
an Original Contributor is entered or selected, the Original Contribution
fields of Amount and Date should follow underneath
Once
all required information is entered (i.e., Contribution Type: Original Source,
Funding Source: Contributors donating more than $10,000, Applicable Contributor
is chosen, Original Contributor Type is chosen, Original Contributor
information [name, address, occupation and employer information for
Individuals], and Original Contribution information [date and amount], an
option below appears to ‘Add another Original Contributor’, and the process can
be repeated, to add multiple Original Contributors under one Applicable Contributor
3.
New warning and possible new Limit functionality
Whenever a contribution is entered under a
contributor that makes the aggregate contributed amount more than $10,000 for
that contributor, the system will generate a warning telling the filer an Original
Source Contribution must be entered for that contributor
This should be similar to the current system
settings and functionality regarding Limits and over-the-limit contribution
warnings, and this new warning could possibly be piggybacked onto Limits
4.
Business rules for new functionality
Original Contribution amounts do
not
have
to equal the aggregate contributed amount from the Applicable Contributor
Original Source transactions must be able to be
deleted, amended, and edited like any other transaction
Original Source and Original Contribution amounts
do
not
influence the cash balance of the committee
Essentially,
they should be treated very similarly to In-Kind Contributions
For reporting purposes, the date assigned to the
Original Source transaction is the date of the contribution that exceeded
$10,000 in aggregate for the Applicable Contributor
Once reported, Original Source transactions and
Schedule A-2 appear on all subsequently filed reports for the election cycle

NOTE:
The "Non-Standard Segment" flag is a way to identify a
non-standard or unverifiable address. This will help
track these addresses in a standardized way and reference them for future processes like redistricting.
These are typically addresses that are not available via SmartyStreets (or USPS, Google Maps) - so will fail map matching - but we would like to capture the address nonetheless. See the related user story for how this will look in voter management:
#73108
This is different from the "UNKNOWN address", where a partial / incomplete address is provided on a written voter registration document, that leads to an incomplete registration. Certain states are required to track attempts at registering, even if unsuccessful (Incomplete/illegible name or address, etc.)

User Story: Manage Special Addresses in Voter Registration System
As a

The grid displays the following columns in this order:
Low Range
High Range
Business Name
Zip Code (5 digits)
The results are organized by the Low Range in ascending order (from lowest to highest).
Edit or Delete Existing Addresses:
Users can select any address from the grid to edit or delete.
Upon selecting an address, all relevant fields (Street Name, Side, Low Range, High Range, Business Name, Zip Code) are populated with the existing data.

Any address marked as a Healthcare Facility will display a special notation throughout the system, similar to the notation for underage voters.
Future Reporting Capability:
The system should be prepared for future enhancements, allowing the generation of voter reports and absentee ballot request reports specifically for voters registered at or needing assistance to vote due to being at a healthcare facility.

Feature Description
The Polling Location Precinct Assignment module allows administrators to assign a "home" precinct or multiple precincts to a polling location. This assignment designates the polling location shown on the voter's acknowledgment card and information page as their primary polling station. Additionally, the module supports separate precinct assignments for other administrative purposes. The user can select an election, check the status of the location, and set specific operating hours and days for early voting centers. Save and cancel buttons are provided for saving or discarding changes.

User Story: Add/Maintain Candidate Module with Filing Management and Search Functionality
As an
election officer,
I want
a comprehensive candidate management module that allows me to select an election, district type, district, and office, input candidate information, track the filing status with a unique application number, and search for candidate filings based on various criteria,
so that
I can accurately manage and track candidate filings, link them to the correct election and office, and retrieve data efficiently.
Description:
The Add/Maintain Candidate Module is designed to provide election officers with a streamlined process for managing candidate filings within the context of specific elections. The process begins by selecting the relevant election, district type, district, and office. Once these selections are made, the election officer can proceed to enter the candidate's personal information, including legally required fields such as name, address, occupation, and more.
Additionally, this module will generate a unique application number for each candidate filing within an election and track the filing's status throughout the election cycle (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected, Withdrawn). The system will also provide robust search functionality, allowing users to filter and refine search results by election, district, office, or a combination of these criteria.

: The "Main Signature" is the signature that will be used to identify the voter in various processes such as ePollbook exports, maintaining absentee ballots, generating paper poll book reports, and petition verification.
New Signature Capture
:
When a new signature is captured and associated with a voter record:
The user will define whether the new signature should replace the current main signature through the user interface at the time of capture.
If the user designates the new signature as the main, the newly captured signature will replace the previous main signature.
If the user does not designate the new signature as the main, the current main signature will remain unchanged, and the new signature will be added to the voter’s record.
Acceptance Criteria:
Signature Navigation
:
The first signature presented is the Main Signature assigned to the voter record.
The user can view previous signatures by clicking a "View Previous" button and navigate forward using a "View Next" button.

The system must display a required dropdown for "Method" with the following options:
Absentee by Mail
Early Voting In-person
Election Day
Selection of a method must dynamically change the options available in fields (e.g., polling location or ballot return method).
Request Location

Depending on the selected "Method," the system should display a required dropdown with appropriate options:
If "Absentee by Mail" is selected, the system should default to the election office.
If "Early Voting In-person" or "Election Day" is selected, the system should display a list of valid polling locations or early voting centers.
If "Election Day", the request and return locations shall be linked and identical.
Ballot Sent Date & Ballot Received Date
:
Two required fields must be available for input: "Ballot Sent Date" and "Ballot Received Date."
These fields must validate input as valid date formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY) and ensure "Received Date" is not earlier than "Sent Date."
These fields will be locked when Election Day participation is being added. The sent and received date will both be the same day as the election.
Ballot Return Method

The user can fill out any combination of these fields, and entries are optional until at least one voter ID is provided.
Voter ID numbers must be validated against the database to ensure they exist and are eligible for participation history updates in the selected election.
Error Handling for Invalid or Duplicate Voter IDs
:
If any voter ID numbers are invalid (i.e., do not exist in the database), the system must skip those entries and notify the user at the end of the process.
If a voter ID already has participation history for the selected election, that entry should also be skipped, and the user must be alerted of this during the confirmation stage.
Confirmation and Final Alerts
:
After all voter IDs are processed, the system must display a final confirmation showing:
The number of successful voter participation entries.
Any voter IDs that were skipped due to errors or existing participation history.
The user must have the option to download or view a detailed report of which voter IDs failed and why.
Security and Permissions
:
Only authorized users with appropriate access should be able to manually input voter participation history.
All manual entries should be logged, including the user performing the task, timestamps, and any skipped entries, for audit purposes.

Description:
The Add/Maintain Absentee Ballot Requests feature provides election officers with the ability to efficiently manage absentee ballot requests. Officers can input and track information such as the date of request, method of request, status, mailing address, and voter contact information (email and phone).

The system allows officers to issue ballots after confirming the voter’s Ballot Style Information and Voting Details. Ballots can only be issued after ballot styles have been created, and ballots can only be sent after the election's absentee send date has been reached and before the absentee request deadline. Three methods for sending ballots are supported:

The user can search for previously merged voter records using the following fields:
Drivers License/State ID
SSN
Voter Registration #
Last Name
First Name
Date of Birth
The system must return results indicating voters who have been merged.

The
Duplicate Voter Search Module
allows county-level election officials to search for potential duplicate voter registrations within a county or across the state. The module provides various search fields, including Drivers License/State ID, SSN, voter registration numbers, and personal identifiers like name and date of birth. Users can review and compare potential duplicates, select the correct registration, and merge the records, ensuring accurate voter registration and an audit history of changes. The system also enables users to designate records as "Non-Duplicates" for future reference.
Search Functionality
:
The user can search for potential duplicates using one or more of the following fields:
Drivers License/State ID
SSN
Voter Registration #1
Voter Registration #2
Last Name
First Name
Date of Birth
If a voter registration number is entered, and it exists in the database, search results will be defined based on the provided number.
Duplicate Records Display
:
After the search is initiated, the system displays potential duplicate records in a grid format, showing key voter information for each record.
Record Comparison
:
Users are prompted to select two records for comparison.
Upon clicking "Review", the system will display the two most recent registrations for each potential duplicate.
The system will allow the user to confirm which registration is more recent.
Merging Records
:
Once the user selects the most recent record, the system merges the registration, participation, etc. and audit history into the "surviving record" with the voter's ID/VUID retained from the older record.
The "non-surviving" record is then canceled and the canceled reason is set to MERGED, to prevent it from showing up in future searches.
A notification is automatically sent to the previous county informing them of the voter registration change.
Non-Duplicate Designation
:
Users can designate records as "Non-Duplicates," which prevents those pairs from being flagged as duplicates in future searches until conditions change.
Audit and Notifications
:
The system logs all changes made during the merge process for auditing purposes.
A notification is sent to the previous county when a merge takes place, detailing the merged records and any relevant changes.
Suggested Test Cases:
Basic Search Functionality
:
Test that a user can search using one or multiple fields (Drivers License, SSN, etc.) and receive appropriate search results based on the input.
Search with Voter Registration Number
:
Enter a valid Voter Registration #1 or Voter Registration #2 and confirm the system correctly returns matching results if the record exists.
No Matches Found
:
Perform a search using invalid or non-existing data and verify that the system appropriately displays a "No duplicates found" message.
Duplicate Selection and Comparison
:
Verify that the user can select two potential duplicate records from the grid and that both records are correctly displayed for comparison.
Merging of Records
:
Select the most recent voter registration and merge records. Ensure the merged data is correctly saved and that the older voter ID/VUID is retained.
Non-Duplicate Designation
:
Select two records and designate them as "Non-Duplicates." Confirm that these records are no longer flagged in future searches unless data changes.
Audit History
:
Verify that all actions (searches, comparisons, merges, designations) are logged in the system’s audit history, accessible by administrators.
Notification of County Registrar
:
After merging records, check that the system sends a notification to the previous county registrar detailing the change in voter registration.
Re-run of Duplicate Search
:
Perform a second search after merging or designating records as "Non-Duplicates" to confirm that the designated or merged records no longer appear as potential duplicates.

Feature Description
:
As a county election official, I want to import electronic poll book files after an election to ensure that all voter check-in data is correctly applied to the voter participation history in the system. This process will allow me to track voter participation in the specified election and handle any discrepancies that arise during the import process.
Election Selection Before Upload

The user must be prompted to select an election date and name before uploading/importing the poll book file.
The system should display a list of available active elections for selection.
The user cannot proceed with the file upload without selecting an election date and name.
Database Check for Voter ID Matching
:
Upon file upload, the system will parse the file and check voter ID numbers against the database.
If a match is found, the system will update the participation history for the selected election for each voter.
If a voter already has participation history or requested absentee ballot for the selected election, the system must alert the user and present the duplicate entries in a list for the user to investigate after the process is ran.
Error Handling for Unmatched Voter IDs
:
The system must flag any voter IDs in the file that do not match a record in the database.
The system will display a clear alert to the user, specifying which voter IDs could not be matched and asking if the user wishes to proceed with the rest of the file.
Completion Notification
:
Upon successful processing of the file, the system must display a summary of the number of records processed, including:
Number of voters successfully updated.
Number of voter IDs not found.
Any voter participation history that was skipped due to a conflict (already voted).
The user must have the ability to download a report of any issues encountered (e.g., unmatched voter IDs, skipped entries).

Users will be able to view, manage, and archive batches that they have created or have been assigned, and they can index scanned documents by associating them with a voter through the system.
Batch View and Access
The user can navigate to the "Batch Scan" area from the Voter Management module.
The user will see two categories of batches: open and closed.
Only batches created by or assigned to the user are visible in the Batch Scan area.

A "Start New Batch" button is available in the Batch Scan area.
Upon clicking "Start New Batch," the user is taken to the scanning screen where they can begin scanning documents.
Scanning and Indexing Documents
The user can scan one or more documents to add to the active batch.
After scanning, the user can input a voter ID, and the system will return the voter's first name, last name, and birthdate.
If the voter ID does not match any records, an error message will be displayed.
Selecting Document Metadata
The user is required to select both the document name and document type for each scanned image.
The selected document name and document type are retained as defaults for subsequent documents but can be changed manually by the user for each new document.
Adding Documents to List
After assigning a voter and selecting the document metadata, the user can click "Add to List," which will attach the scanned document to the voter.
The Scanned Documents list will show the filename and associated voter for each document.
The next document in the batch will automatically load, and the document number will increment to show progress.
The voter lookup field will be cleared for the next entry.
Committing a Batch
When all documents in the batch have been assigned, the system will notify the user to commit the batch.
Upon committing the batch, all documents will be attached to the respective voter profiles.
The attached documents will be viewable under the "Attachments" tab in the voter's profile.

A state statute allows judicial candidates to
request
that their personal information (name, address, and
email address) be redacted from the Guardian system.
#67025
Additionally, they may
request
that the sam
e
information be redacted for family members who are officers of the candidate committee.
Civix
will
update the Guardian system to allow administrators to mark candidates and other officers for redaction.
When a candidate or other officer has been marked for redaction, their personal information will be
hidden on the public site but still displayed in the secure site.
Specifying Officers to Redact
#67026
In order to
facilitate
a redaction for a candidate or one of their officers, the redaction request will be
entered on the Associate Information page. This page is reached by clicking the “Update” link in the
Registered Users grid on the Entity Administration page for the candidate committee, as shown below.
On the Associate Information page, we will add a checkbox labeled “Redact
”.
Checking this checkbox
and clicking “Update” will perform the redaction for that officer.
If both the candidate and another officer need to have their information redacted, the “Associate
Information” page will need to be updated for each one separately.
Results of Redaction
When the “Redact” checkbox has been checked, the data will remain the same in the database, but the
sensitive information will be hidden from the public.
The candidate and other officers’ data will continue to be displayed on the Entity Administration page in
the secure site. However, on the public site, the redacted data will display as follows on the
Candidate
Committee Detail page:
Redacted
Redacted
, OK 99999

officers’ data that was specified to be redacted will display as follows:
Redacted
Redacted
, OK 99999
(999) 999-9999
Redacted@Redacted.com
This will be displayed the same, whether the registration form is viewed from the public site or the
secure site, since the same form is used on both sites.
Reversing a Redaction
#67022
A redaction can be reversed by unchecking the “Redact” checkbox on the Associate Information page
and clicking “Update
”.
After the redaction is reversed, the personal information will display

The Single Scan module will allow users to scan a document and optionally crop and capture a voter's signature to attach it to their voter registration record. Users can access the "Single Scan" page from the voter search results or voter info page. The module includes fields to select the document type, source of scan, and options to upload a file from a local source. Users can capture a signature and replace the voter's current signature or add a new one if no signature is on file. The scanned signature can be previewed, redrawn, and saved alongside the document.
Main Signature Identification
:
The first signature associated with the voter record, regardless of source (scanned document, online registration, government agency transmission, or poll book upload), will automatically be designated as the "Main" voter signature.
Main Signature Definition
: The "Main Signature" is the signature that will be used to identify the voter in various processes such as ePollbook exports, maintaining absentee ballots, generating paper poll book reports, and petition verification.
New Signature Capture
:
When a new signature is captured and associated with a voter record:
The user will define whether the new signature should replace the current Main signature through the user interface at the time of capture.
If the user designates the new signature as the Main, the newly captured signature will replace the previous Main signature.
If the user does not designate the new signature as the Main, the current Main signature will remain unchanged, and the new signature will be added to the voter’s record.
Navigation to "Single Scan" Page
The user can navigate to the "Single Scan" page from the voter search results.
The user can navigate to the "Single Scan" page from the voter information page.

As a county election administrator,
I need to define the order and details of an election event's contests and measures,
So that I can continue setting up my election.
Ballot order refers to the sequence in which candidates' names appear on the ballot during an election. This order can significantly impact election outcomes due to the "ballot order effect," where candidates listed first may receive more votes simply because of their position
Why Ballot Order Exists
Minimize Bias
: To reduce any potential bias that might arise from the order in which candidates are listed. Some states use randomization to ensure fairness
Standardization
: To create a consistent and organized voting process. Different states have various methods for determining ballot order, such as alphabetical order, incumbency, or random selection
Voter Convenience
: To make it easier for voters to find and select their preferred candidates, especially in elections with many candidates
Methods of Determining Ballot Order
Alphabetical Order
: Candidates are listed alphabetically by their last names.
Incumbency
: Incumbents may be listed first.
Randomization
: Names are listed in a random order, often determined by a lottery or drawing
Party Affiliation
: Candidates from the major parties might be listed first, followed by minor party and independent candidates
A ballot rotation algorithm is a method used to vary the order of candidates' names on ballots across different precincts or districts. This ensures that each candidate appears in each position (first, second, third, etc.) an approximately equal number of times. The goal is to minimize any advantage that might come from being listed first, known as the "ballot order effect"
How It Works
Randomization
: The initial order of candidates is determined randomly.
Rotation
: The order is then systematically rotated for each precinct or district. For example, if there are three candidates (A, B, and C), the order might be:
Precinct 1: A, B, C
Precinct 2: B, C, A
Precinct 3: C, A, B
Benefits
Fairness
: Ensures no candidate consistently benefits from being listed first.
Equal Exposure
: Gives all candidates an equal chance to be noticed by voters.
Setting the "Vote For" value in a given contest within your election definition is crucial for several reasons:
Reasons to Set the "Vote For" Value
Clarity for Voters
: It clearly indicates how many candidates a voter can select in a particular contest. For example, in a city council election where multiple seats are available, the "Vote For" value might be set to 3, allowing voters to choose up to three candidates.
Accurate Ballot Design
: Ensures that the ballot is designed correctly, reflecting the rules of the election. This helps prevent voter confusion and reduces the likelihood of errors, such as overvoting (selecting more candidates than allowed).
Compliance with Election Laws
: Adheres to legal requirements and election regulations, which often specify the number of candidates that can be voted for in different types of contests.
Efficient Vote Counting
: Facilitates accurate and efficient vote counting and tabulation. When the "Vote For" value is set correctly, it helps election officials quickly identify and address any issues with ballots that do not comply with the voting rules.
Transparency and Fairness
: Promotes transparency and fairness in the election process by ensuring that all candidates and voters understand the rules and that the election is conducted according to those rules.
Example
In a school board election with five open seats, setting the "Vote For" value to 5 allows voters to select up to five candidates. This ensures that the election results accurately reflect the voters' preferences for all available positions.
The system must provide authorized users with a landing page where they can search the Election Contests currently assigned to the election in this Region, by the following parameters:
Contest Name
District Type
District Name
The system must provide the user with a results grid containing the following elements:
Action menu (with View/Configure as actions)
Contest Name
District Name
District Type
Vote For
Rotation
Ballot Order
This module must allow the user to view and manage:
The contests and measures that will be included in this election event
The ballot order of those contests and measures
The rotation algorithm appropriate for each contest in the election event
The Ballot Vote-For for each contest in the election event
The ability to create new contests

The Voter Signature Capture feature allows election staff to extract and update a voter’s signature from a scanned document. Users can crop the signature from the document image, preview it, and choose to replace the voter’s main signature with the newly captured one. This functionality ensures accurate and up-to-date voter records while providing flexibility in managing voter signatures.
Create Crop Copy (Signature) Checkbox
When the "Create Crop Copy (Signature)" checkbox is unchecked, no signature cropping actions are available.
When the "Create Crop Copy (Signature)" checkbox is checked, the "Capture Signature" button becomes visible.
A checkbox becomes visible to allow the user to choose if the newly captured signature will replace the voter's main signature.
Capture Signature Button
When the "Capture Signature" button is clicked, the user is prompted to drag a rectangle over the scanned document image to crop the signature.
A preview of the cropped signature is displayed next to the scanned document.
The user can click the "Capture Signature" button again to redraw the signature area.
The preview of the signature updates after each crop action.
Preview of Captured Signature
After cropping the signature, a preview is shown next to the document image.
The user can click the "Capture Signature" button to redraw and update the cropped area, which will update the preview accordingly.
Replace Signature Functionality
If the "replace main signature" checkbox is checked, the newly captured signature replaces the current main signature for the voter.
If no main signature is on file, the captured signature is automatically set as the main signature for the voter.
Error Handling for Missing Signature
If the user attempts to upload a document with the "Create Crop Copy (Signature)" checkbox checked but without capturing a signature, an error notification is displayed.
The error message informs the user to either capture a signature or uncheck the "Create Crop Copy (Signature)" box to proceed.
The user is prevented from uploading the document until the error is resolved.

As a county election official,
I want the ability to update or add a new felon queue,
so that we ensure that voter records are accurately maintained.
Acceptance Criteria:
The system must allow authorized users to update or upload a felon queue to check against current and future registered voters.
The user can schedule, or immediately run,
a processes in
the background and the system will attempt to match registered voters with a status other than "Cancelled" against list of felons in the system using a user defined search criteria.
The system will return potential matches to a queue for the user to review.
The user selects a voter that is a potential match to someone the felon list.
T
he user should be able to review the potential matches from the felon list simultaneously with the voter registration data and
select an option to designate that this voter is a match or non-match to the felon list.
Upon marking a voter as a
non-match:
The system should automatically remove the voter’s name from future potential matches of the list of felons it checked against.
If the voter updates their registration before a new felon list is updated/added, there will be no need to perform this query again.
If the Felon list has been updated since the last voter registration update, the system will query the voter against the new felon list.
Upon marking the voter as a
match:
The voter will be marked with a Status of Cancelled and a Status Reason of Convicted Felon.
The felon selected as a match will be removed from future potential matches until the next felon list is uploaded/updated.
Ensure that the removal action is logged for auditing purposes, including the details of the authorized user who performed the action and the date and time it was performed.
The system should provide a confirmation prompt or notification to the user once the voter is successfully removed from the felon queue, ensuring clear communication and verification of actions taken.

Miami-Dade LRS suspends users who don't file their expenditure reports starting on Sep 1 following the missed reporting deadline. Suspended status needs to lock the user from adding new Principals. They need to be able to file late reports in addition to pay any outstanding fines related to the filing so as to be able to clear their suspended status. The system needs a straight forward way to suspend all late filers by an admin action or an automatic job that has a variable date that is selectable in the application.

parent Feature for all placeholder user stories for Base Product.

As a county user,
I want to be able to create and manage precinct splits within the election management system,
so that I can assign pre-existing street segments and districts to each split, while ensuring proper validation, automatic naming conventions, and accurate reporting of district-to-precinct and precinct-to-district relationships.
Precinct Split Option:
Provide the option to "Split" a precinct. A Split Precinct is an easy way to identify different districts of the same district type that fall within the same precinct.
After a precinct is created, the user will have the option to "split" it, which will create a copy of the precinct-to-district relationship of the now "Parent" precinct. This new precinct will not be able to be saved until it contains at least one unique district-to-precinct relationship as the Parent precinct, or any previously made splits from that parent.
There can only be one Parent Precinct. There is no limit on child precincts that can come from a parent.
A precinct split is only used to determine an individual street segment’s voting details. The Parent Precinct is what is used to determine the Polling Location and the smallest unit in which to tally ballot information from each district within the Parent Precinct.
Precinct Creation and Management
The system must allow the creation of precinct splits via a button on the
Precinct-Split
tab.
When the button is activated, the
Precinct-Split Relationship
page will load, and the grid will appear identical to the
Parent Precinct
grid.
The
Parent Precinct
must be included as a static field.
The
Precinct Split Name
field must be editable and auto-generated as the parent precinct name with a numerical suffix that reflects how many splits there are. For example:
The first split will be auto-generated as the parent precinct name with "1/1" appended.
The second split will have "2/2" appended, and so on for each additional split.
The
Precinct-Split Code
must be editable and auto-generated as the parent precinct code with a two-digit numerical suffix reflective of the number of splits:
The first split will be auto-generated with "01" appended to the parent precinct code.
The second split will have "02" appended, and so on for each additional split.
Each time a new split is added, all district assignments from the parent precinct (or the split precinct being further split) must be
automatically copied
to the new split. Users can then modify the assignments as necessary.
The system must allow the user to search for and assign pre-existing street segments and districts to the precinct split.
Precinct Assignment
The system must provide a search function for users to find pre-existing street segments by address range, street name, or district.
Users must be able to select and assign these street segments and districts to the newly created precinct split.
District Assignment
: The system must ensure that precinct-splits within a parent precinct have at least
one unique district assignment
. However, multiple precinct splits within the same parent precinct will share other district assignments.
Street Segment Assignment
: A street segment can only be assigned to
one precinct-split
. If no precinct-split exists, the segment can only be assigned to the
parent precinct
directly.
Validation
The system must validate that each street segment can only be assigned to a single precinct-split or parent precinct (if no splits exist).
It must ensure that precinct-splits within a parent precinct have at least one unique district assignment while allowing shared districts for other assignments.
The system must validate that the
Parent Precinct
remains active and contains all district types that are distributed across the precinct splits. This means that the parent precinct should retain a summary or cumulative view of all districts assigned to its splits.
The system must prevent the creation of precinct splits without assigned street segments or districts.
Reporting
The system must generate reports showing which street segments and districts have been assigned to each precinct split.
The system must allow users to generate reports on:
District to Precinct Relationships
: Showing which districts are assigned to which precincts and precinct splits.
Precinct to District Relationships
: Showing all districts assigned to a specific precinct or precinct split.
Precinct Splits
: Displaying all splits within a precinct and the associated districts and street segments.
The system should allow users to export precinct split data, district-to-precinct relationships, and precinct-to-district relationships in a CSV or PDF format.

Per
@Zach Cashion
The Problem:
While investigating the performance issues for the filer home page, I discovered that the slowness is caused by the api call GetLmsToDoList, which makes sense since Immediate To Do is the main part of the home page. I then preceded to investigate why it was taking so long to get the information from api call GetLmsToDoList. Following the logic down to the database stored procedure [usp_Lobbyist_Registrant_Get_ImmediateToDoList] and running some performance test, I could tell that the stored proc was struggling to return results quickly. After spending three days trying to rewrite the procedure to get it to run faster, I am seeing no meaningful speed improvements. The main problem is that instead of creating [ToDoTask] (notifications) and saving it to the [ToDoTask_Table] most of the [ToDoTask] 's are being calculated every time someone reloads the home page which causes really bad performance. There are 16 ToDoTask categories as of the time of this writing and a lot of the work to fix this in LRS is already in place. There is a table in the database called [ToDoTask] for storing this information with type codes and subtype codes [ToDoTaskType] and [ToDoTaskSubType]. Most of this seams to be done in CFIS but not in LRS. Two categories seem to already be working in LRS, Client Authorized Lobbyist & Client Denied Lobbyist notifications. I will list out required stories to fix the other categories.

Remove unneeded fields from Ethics Application that are not being utilized.
Benefits:
More efficient Data Structure
Will upgrade performance
Reduce overall cost
Step 1:
Make full copy of schema for a CFIS, FDS, LRS, Public
Remove un-needed fields
Go through Schema to Identify Every Tables and Data, and how we want them to be split out.
Develop procedures for data schema changes.

When a UCC-1, 3, or 5 image is scanned/uploaded or created by the system (paper and online filings), upon approval the image will be redirected to Extract Systems for redaction of keywords defined by the state (see attached). Images not being made available until the redaction process is in feature #
82878
If the image returns with redacted data, that image becomes Version 2 and is the publicly viewable image. This image is now available for the public to view and will return in UCC-11 searches. (IsRedacted is 1)
If the image returns from extract, but no redaction is made, that image will now be available for public consumption.
This image is now available for the public to view and will return in UCC-11 searches. This image will be flagged as having gone through the redaction process. (IsViewable is marked 1)
Office correction - image regeneration and image upload - These images would need to be sent for redactions
Any rules we want to apply to not send the documents for redaction such as Transmitting Utility, bulk filed documents can be ignored to be sent because they come from trusted source
,Inhouse users decide not to redact
UCC List of redactions are attached

Steps in legacy image conversion:
On-demand image conversion
When an image is requested for view or UCC-11 search, the image will be pulled from the NY legacy FileNet. That image will now be 'converted' and will not need to be converted during the bulk process
Legacy GUID needs to be saved
New GUID for S3 needs to be created
Online will only show redacted legacy images (based on IsRedacted flag - and isViewable -
if image is not redacted, system alert is "Image is not available"
InHouse will show redacted and unredacted images
Batch image conversion process
Process runs in the backend that converts all images from FileNet to the Civix S3 bucket
Legacy GUID needs to be saved
New GUID for S3 needs to be created
If image is already converted in on-demand conversion, batch process will skip and not convert again
Process will not affect production performance

Not deleting the temporary documents that are uploaded into S3, which fills the file system.

Inactivating a row in a lookup table should prevent using that lookup value in adding any new records or updating any existing records containing that value. However, the value should still be displayed in any records currently using it. If a record using the value is brought up in a screen or dialog in edit mode, the filed containing the no longer active lookup value should display the current, inactive value, be flagged on-screen as needing to be updated with an appropriate message, and the system should prevent saving changes to the record until the inactive lookup value has been replaced with an active one. Any reports or forms filed containing the lookup should display the inactive lookup value and/or description (depending on the report/form). This ticket pertains to an inactivated BusinessType code and the correct display and update behavior for Contributor-Payees that were assigned that code prior to inactivating it.
A CSV file containing transactions linked to the inactivated code is attached to the ticket, This can be used to look up filers and their donor/payees affected for diagnosis and QA purposes.

1) Edit the Contributor / Payee. This contributor/payee should have a business type that is no longer active in the reference table.
expected result
all the information entered at the initial creation of the contributor / payee is visible on the edit screen
If the filer tries to save a contributor that contains a business type that is no longer active, display a message that prevents the filer from continuing until the validation is passed. "
Please select a valid Business Type. The current selection is no longer supported."
The information entered for the contributor payee matches in the application and on the filed report
actual result
business type is not visible because the value has been set to inactive
business type is not visible in the application but the business type is visible on the filed report pdf
For the Edit Contributor/Payee Screen, if a contributor/payee was originally created with the business type of "business", it should be displayed on the screen. For the creation of new contributor/payees, they cannot select a business type of "business" because that value has been marked as inactive in the system code tables.
Edit Contributor/Payee Screen with Business Type missing
filed report with business type visible
You can see that the business type value of business was turned to inactive in March. Any contributor/payee that selected that value before March when it was still active is now affected by this. This value should still be seen in the UI for these affected contributor/payees, however, when a new contributor/payee is created, they should not have the business value as an option because it is set to inactive.
Example of a filer who has a missing business type. Contributor: Chevron
----------------------------------
implemented JS variable to fetch selected business type is active if not display a message to select valid business type and disable Update for that contributor/payee until valid selection

Message from Client
Environment: UAT
While testing in UAT, I filed a report for filer ID 135270 as an admin, and purposely left fields blank in the data entry sections. The system let me file anyway. When I went to look at the report to verify the fields were left blank, the report would not pull up and I was left with an error screen
This bug was not reproducible after these many years. However, I did wob of the filer and noticed that the report they filed in was amended and the older version on the public site is not displayed

[05/09/2022] Needs to be groomed/verified.

Lauri reported this yesterday and I have looked at this in VREMS and in the CHANGE AUDIT table (and a few others) and cannot determine why these people have had their status changed.
Lauri suspects that, at least for two of them, it might be that they were scanned in from the voter register by mistake and then removed, and that is why it appears with the 11/3/20 date, but we have no way to know that, and, if that is
the situation, if someone has had their Voter History removed, the dates should have reverted.
Hey Steven,
Per our phone call today, we are trying to figure out how these three voters got changed from A/LM in 2020 to A/RG and wanted to make sure there wasn’t an issue here or a procedural thing we need to address.
I’m thinking these are somehow related to a Voter History (VH) data entry error that was later corrected in the DO? However, only one of the three voter records below shows a temp staff’s name in the audit log if the reason was VH. No
voter history, absentee or petition activity shows on their records either.
Or maybe staff performed a voter contact update and did not scan a support doc even though it changed the voter’s Status/Condition Code but again, no Change Audit History for 11/7/20 except the 1st voter listed below.
All three voters listed below have these things in common:
Steven Niven in the Audit Log on 11/25/19 which I assume was related to A/LM in 2019.
All show a Status/Condition Code date of 11/07/20 and a Last Contact Date of 11/03/20.
No supporting document to show how the voter went from A/LM to A/RG.

Modifying the work from this ticket to possibly check on the status of these items. Below is the initial description from the CR revolving around the Return Status Options.
Return Status Options – minor changes and
rule regarding participation
We have reviewed and revised as necessary
the options a clerk has for the return of an absentee ballot, and the reasons a
ballot is marked defective.
These
options are now accurate, not duplicative, and appropriately named.
We now need to ensure that:
Options in batch should match those in the
single absentee ballot entry screens.
We
think the only adjustment here is to change “Return a Ballot” to “Received –
Accepted.”

Validation Status
: For
Returned Ballots, Voters Ballot Status is displaying as “Received – Accepted”

Only those voters marked “received – accepted” or
“defective” should appear on the participation report. -

Validation Status:
Voter Participation screen list is displaying
with Received-Accepted status Absentee Ballot Request voters only. Need to
validate for “Defective” Status.
Must ensure that the checklist appropriately
reflects the return statuses: must show those received and accepted (means the
voter cannot vote again in person), and those received and defective (giving
the voter an opportunity to cure at the polls), but not show those in any of
the other return statuses.
Currently the
checklist says “Ret” for any that are returned.
We would like it to display “Def” for any currently marked Defective.

From AK:
In the Processed Questioned Ballots module,
If I select the Save button, without a Precinct #/Name, it allows me to proceed into the ballot logging screen to process AND IT SHOULD NOT do this because, you MUST have the district and precinct information because otherwise,
it is NOT in the grid where you log the ballots.
I discovered this in UAT but, I tried it in Production and it was an issue in both environments.

Good Afternoon,
The Limits for the Political Committee/Legislative Caucus Committee are not working correctly. Vaidy and I went over the settings and the Violations do not match the settings. Please let me know if there are any questions.
The example for the issue is Filer ID 1869.
NOTE to Developer: If unfamiliar with Limits, please meet with Rick Petrecca on this for details on how the Limits work. Also, read the discussions below.
Login to NM Prod as an admin
Go to Limits and Thresholds
Select Contribution Limits
Review the limits for Political Committees to view the LCC committee type limits
Note that the limits imposed from 1/1/23 to 12/31/24 are $27,500 for an individual, business, PAC, or other LCC
Work on Behalf of filer 1869 (This is an LCC type committee subject to $27,500 limits currently)
Go to the Reports screen for the filer
Go to Filed Reports
Select either of the displayed filed reports and
view the report
Select Review Violations for the report
Expected Results
Any reported violations on the Review Violations dialog should show aggregate contributions form the listed contributor that exceed the limit.
AND/OR
Any reported violations on the Review Violations dialog should have contributions transactions on the filed reports that exceed the limit
Actual Results
Aggregates of contributions from the reported violations do not exceed the appropriate limits.
A stored procedure update was required for both the transaction submission page that shows the popup when a violation limit is met, and the violations listing on the Potential Violations page.
The former was not taking into account Committee Subtypes, and the latter was selecting too many rows.

Public transaction search does not return certain matching transactions, all Contributions reported by filer are not listed in Contributions screen for filer, and certain transaction are not included in the data download. :

When I go to the public site, and click on Explore Transactions > Contributions, click all of the years going back to 2018, Add Filter of Contributor/Payee Name, and copy+paste "QC Holdings Inc" as it appears in the filed Biannual, I cannot find this transaction in the list.

Can you explain to me why the QC Holdings Inc contribution that is reported in the attached file cannot be found in the public search?

I want to
use Import Manager to import transactions using Election Type = Local
So that I can
import transactions correctly.
1) Log in to NM Demo-AU
2) Work on behalf of a user registered for a local election
3) Import a file through import manager which contains an election year for a local election which is not configured yet through Filing Schedule
4) Note when the transactions is reviewed in import manager, no error is displayed to show user that the election year they tried to enter is not configured/does not exist in system. Jennifer to come up with messaging on how the error should look.
Expected
- When user uploads a contribution for local election and the year specified is not a year configured in the system for local elections, import manager should throw an error.
Actual
- When user uploads a contribution for local election and the year specified is not a year configured in the system for local elections, import manager is simply assigning it to their registered election and displaying a warning.

When I process VRs, the suffix from one voter will attach to the next voter. For example Michael A. Thiel has never been in our system as
Michael A. Thiel Jr., I even pulled his card to check. The Jr. simply appears
because the voter before him was Terry K. Harden Jr. I’ve attached their actual
cards that we have on file to show the Jr. and that in our old Vigo County
registration Michael never was under Jr.

As a

I want to
add Affiliated Committees
So that I can

Affiliated committee entry in BP
Req 39692 -
The registration statement filed by a committee with the city clerk must include:
d) The full name of any other committee or a non-municipal political organization that is organized, financed, maintained, or controlled by the same person or group of persons as the committee filing the registration statement, and in the case of a non-municipal political organization registered with the Colorado Secretary of State's campaign finance system, the organization's state-assigned Committee ID number.
To fix - Will need to add Treasurer name fields on initial +Add affiliated comm > Other Flow as non required fields.
1) Register a candidate
When initially creating a committee there are no name fields, but after saving and clicking update name fields appear. Parts of the grid are also blank.
No name fields:
Blank parts of grid:
Name fields present after clicking update:
Adding a name and updating fills in the Treasurer part of the grid:
Since there wasn't a requirement to add Treasurer name or any of the additional fields displayed in the grid for affiliated committees, I would suggest hiding those fields during edit and on the grid. If that is too much work however, we need to include those fields on the first pass when entering an affiliated committee.

Hi Mandy and Lauren,
CFIS is still timing out when uploading spreadsheets. We understand this issue came to your attention about 10 days ago and the software has not been fixed yet.
As Sandra and I are doing reports for numerous candidates, we would like to request an extension, without penalty. The candidates include at least the following, who have large spreadsheets to upload:
Charlotte Little, HD68
Mimi Stewart, SD17
Others may add more candidates to this list. We contacted Vaidy who was kind enough to respond, but he said he is no longer working on CFIS.

Filer imported transactions via import manager and accepted them. (example file attached)
Filer has immediate to dos to update contributor info, however the immediate to dos should not have been created. States Business Type needs populating.
Here you can see Business Type is already populated.
@Julie Spencer
provided the following additional information on this issue.
The step of the import process which creates the ToDoTask does not have the correct logic. The stored procedure being used
usp_Import_Insert_ToDoTask_Contributor calls the function ToDoTask_Contribution_AggregationAmount and in that function it is joining with the Member table to get the contributor's record and determining if it has the OccupationCode when the contributor is and Individual or that it has a BusinessTypeCode when it a different type of contributor. That would be good except it finds a record for (in our example) AFT New Mexico where the BusinessTypeCode is NULL; however, that was the first version of the contributor and not the most recent version. The function ToDoTask_Contribution_AggregationAmount needs to be updated to only look at the most recent version of the contributor record and then determine if OccupationCode or BusinessTypeCode is not there.
After talking with
@Rick Petrecca
, it was determined that only IND, COM, CMT and OTH types should enfore the Business Type limit, and the message should only show for those contributor types. CMT is not currently used in NM, but I kept it in the UI check for consistency with the stored procedure that also contains CMT. The error message should be different for IND types, and CAN, LOB, SELF, and PTY types should not display or message nor should they create a to-do item.
I've also updated the Save feature of the modal to only make the ToDo item go away when the issue has actually been fulfilled. Previously, the ToDo item would go away with any update that happened on the Contributor Update modal, regardless of whether the ToDo item had been fulfilled.

Update 5/7/2024: The issue may only be happening when files are imported via the API.

Hendricks County reported the issue in Prod on 9/4/2024.
VPD VR was rejected for Glenn Jordan. The VPD ABS record in the hopper pops this error that prevents the ABS record from being rejected.
I submitted a combined form and rejected the VR in the hopper. The ABS portion stayed in the VPD-ABS hopper, but when I try to process it, I get the warning message that there is a VR that has to be processed first, so I am unable to open the ABS record to reject it.
Steps:
Submitted a combined ABS-VPD for Helen R Smith (
8920978422) in UAT.
Rejected the VR in the Marion County ABS-VPD VR Hopper.
Validated the ABS did not appear in any hopper.
67512 went out with the August build on 8/22, so I think this has been resolved since this record was processed.

We have found a few lobbyists that are not linking correctly to their 48 hour report. Example is Filer ID 121272. When I click to view the PDF for the 2023 48 hour report, it pulls up a blank Report of Advertising Campaign Reporting Form (wrong template). When I click to view some of his 48 hour report amendments, it shows up blank (no PDF).
Can you consider this a systemic issue and research that all reports for lobbyists pull correctly and regenerate/fix as needed?
Thank you,

Steps:
Log into NM Prod as an admin.
Work on behalf of filer 121045 and 121272
Go to the filed reports page.
View the PDF for the file 48 hour report.
Expected Results:
The PDF that loads should be the 48 hour report the lobbyist filed and contain the lobbyist's data.
Actual Results:
The PDF is a blank lobbying advertising campaign report.
Note:
Julie tried to regenerate the report but the new report was also a blank ad campaign report. Julie also looked at the report data and all data points to the correct 48 hour report.
JS Note:
This is not an issue in the viewing of the report. Our system is accurately presenting the report that was created. The issue is with the creation of the report... per the data the report type is a 48 hour report; however, the report being created is a lobbying advertising campaign report instead.

I reviewed all Lobbyist 48 hour reports filed or due between Jun 3, 2023 and June 4, 2024. All were of the correct format. None were Lobbyist Advertising Campaign reports. Whatever issue may have been happening in April of 2023 appears to have been resolved. I suspect that the wrong report definition was in place and has since been replaced with the correct definition.

Ongoing issue: CEB-9, II had to be manually added by Kevin during the 2024 Primary, as well.
When counties started reporting for the 2023 Primary, several counties noticed their CEB-9 Section II was missing from the Execute CEB Forms module in SVRS.
Kevin manually added the CEB-9 Section II form to 44 counties, and we need to figure out why it attached itself to some counties but not to others.
Confirmed issue resolved on 9/30 in Sandbox. validated all counties see section 2

IT has put the rule to fix this issue

Need to add three reports (2023 Filing Schedules) to all Active Candidates & Committees that do not already have the reports on their reporting schedule.
Reports that need to be added are
Candidates and Committees both need the same three reports added:
2023 1st Quarter Report 01/01/23-03/31/23 File no earlier than 04/01/23 Due Date 04/07/23
2023 2nd Quarter Report 04/01/23-06/30/23 File no earlier than 07/01/23 Due Date 07/07/23
2023 3rd Quarter Report 07/01/23-09/30/23 File no earlier than 10/01/23 Due Date 10/10/23
2023 4th Quarter Report 10/01/23-12/31/23 File no earlier than 01/01/24 Due Date 01/08/24
If there are ACTIVE Committees that do not have the 1st Quarter report, they should be added as well. However that number should be a lot less than the rest of the committees that need the Qtrs 2-4 added. Hopefully that number will be zero, if there are committees that need that still need the 1st Qtr Report that means we missed some when we added it for them in March!
See Julie's query in DevOps Item 48624 she used to provide the list of committees that needed the 1st Qtr Report added.
Thanks

Attempt to process an import file containing an investment transaction of type SOL making sure the Profit and Loss fields contain data formatted as money (so instead of 0 it should contain 0.00). When import process will fail with the error of

In looking at the procedure, the variables for Profit and Loss are identified as INT
but, the related fields on the Transactions table (Profit and Loss) are of type
decimal(19,4)
and the import instructions calls for these fields to be of type money
For a different field... the @InvSoldValue the procedure uses logic to change it into a decimal... it's then used as the TransactionAmount in the insert.
I'm not sure why DECIMAL(18,2) is used instead of the TransactionAmount field's datatype...
... maybe doing similar with Profit and Loss variables... but making them and the TransctionAmount be DECIMAL(19,4) to match the table would be a good thing.

Reopening ticket based on report from Hancock County on 10/2/2024
The VPD email ballot produced the ABS-25 in the Primary, but it produced the ABS-9 in the General.
More voters to review:
Ashley Going
Sarah Huck
Quinn Literal
With the use of Democracy Live, counties don't need the ABS-25 at this time anyway. Do we want to knock both form generations from the VPD?
Originally report April 27, 2022
Stephanie in Marion reported that her ABS-VPD (by email)
voters are generating both an ABS-25 & an ABS-9. ABS-25 is the
correct item and the ABS-9 is for military overseas. The other issue is of the
two items, the ABS-9 is filled in all the way, but the ABS-25 is not even
though that is the correct form.
Side problem is that her FPCA voters who should be getting
an ABS-9 for an email ballot are not generating an ABS-9, instead it’s
generating mailing labels.
Now for some screenshots and explanations in between…
List of steps below, but screenshots won't copy into field
This voter with a VPD by email
Generated both ABS 25 and ABS 9
ABS 25 is barely filled out
ABS 9 is filled out, but it’s the wrong form
This voter with an FPCA Issued by email
It generated mailing labels and no ABS 9
Refer to email from 9/14/23 subject RE: ABS-VPD by email is incorrectly generating abs-9 and other issues - IN Prod for images

Hi Tim,
It appears that the questions on the Tally sheet for the
town of Manchester is duplicating for upcoming General election. Can you please
remove one of them from the table?
The town submitted 2 questions in error but even though the

@Julie Spencer
can we look at this?
They registered for 2023 and already filed a report. The report is now missing and the 2023 cycle has disappeared for them.
JS Note:
It might be good to get the backup from 10/04 which is a day prior to the 10/05 event "Asian American Advocacy Fund Independent Committee has submitted an amended Non-candidate Committee (RO) registration." which resulted in the most recent registration record for this filer to be in the "2021 Independent Committee Filing Cycle" and have PO/BA/QA perform the same event so that dev can watch what occurs... or maybe a back up from 08/31 which is a day before the 09/01 event "Asian American Advocacy Fund Independent Committee has submitted a new Non-candidate Committee (RO) registration." in order for the team to possibly figure out what happened.

This bug was discovered when Jevon was working on a fix in the absentee module for Test VREMS. This is NOT occurring in Production VREMS at this time but, I want to make sure that it does not roll over into Production VREMS.
I added an absentee ballot line to the voter’s record beflow in Activities>Absentee, Early and Questioned Ballots>Add/Update AV App/Ballot, then I went into Activities>Absentee, Early and Questioned Ballots>Process Voted Absentee Ballots to log the ballot to the voter’s record as being received. This voter DID NOT already have a ballot logged as received to their record. In the Ballots Details grid, the system is pre-populating an A code in the Accept field of the grid. It should not. When I select the Edit pencil for the line, the A did go away and then the system presented itself as it should when initially opening the voter record.
This is how it should look when you open a record.
I did then log at ballot to the voter’s record and got the correct messaging and it also displayed the line correctly in the Ballot Details grid.
Absentee Ballot Logging - System is adding information to voters records that shouldn’t be there.
This bug is occurring in production for the voters involved in the REAA recall election.

One calculation still needs to be fixed
The voter history by age report percentage
is way off. The 2022 General Election based on the two highlighted
numbers is 44.44% but it is displaying as 40.10%.

There are now
35
voters showing null precincts on the VH report for Real County. Report #
001113917
. Looks to be showing correctly on Single Voter participation screen as opposed to a few weeks ago, but report is still incorrect.
Part 2:
Creating a new voter in Real County with an address that has an assigned Precinct of 2, 3, or 4 will cause an issue where their Precinct is not shown and instead shows "Null" in the Voter Participation History screen. Example below:
In the Voter Information screen, voter Daniel Keen has a Precinct of "2"
However on the Voter Participation History screen, we see their Precinct is "Null"

Log in as "Real" county user
Navigate to Activities > Voter Registration > Voter Search
Enter any non-existing Last Name, First Name and Date of Birth so you are able to get to the New Voter page

Essentially they would like the Liaison to have the same role as an admin
Liaison makes a change to a filers profile it will send a filing obligation notice and not just that it was a change that was made. But, if admin makes a change it works and does send a notice that a change was made. If some one is active or leaving to active will need the initial obligation.
Make a change to copy the admin settings to the liaison.

Lobbyist ID 439346 has entered political contributions on behalf of her employer Merk Sharp and Dohme LLC on her January 15, 2024 report but it is showing a wrong name on the PDF. Can you change “Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp and its Affiliates to Merch Sharp and Dohm LLC on the PDF?
This is a bug we have experienced numerous times before where the filer is choosing the correct name from the UI but the PDF prints an older version of the name on the PDF.

From KH: During the last primary election, we encountered problems with Harris
County being able to submit ENR results due to the length/number of
offices on the enr data entry screen. We need to be sure the allowable
number of races has been extended to include the entire ballot. We
cannot have a repeat of this issue.
TE Edit - We need to find out what the current limit is for the page on how many races it can show, and then we need to increase it depending on the current Harris ballot.

User replied back she was able to enter transactions using Edge. Does not make any sense, since I was able to log in using Chrome, (same browser as she was originally using) and the same username and password she was using and not get an error.
I'm saying this was user error.

Transaction was entered initially as an in-kind transaction, it should have been Cash (Itemized).
Deleted it and added it back in correctly.
Not sure what happened, but there are now two offset records, and they don't have the option to delete the extra one.
Deleted extra offset record with the following script:
Delete From Contribution
Where ContributionID = 1106693

When multiple registrations updates are submitted online with voter precinct changes the registration is auto-activating, it should be placed in Pending for the 7-day waiting period.
The following is an example in Sandbox.
2. Voter registrations are auto-activating when there is a pending 7-day waiting period registration already existing for the voter.
See attached recording.
3. VRAs are not updating the date sent when printed.
4. Voter record auto-activated without VRA being sent (similar to #2).
Scenario 1
Submit a Voter update with a precinct change on indianavoters. Submit the same update multiple times.
In SVRS process the most recent update.
Expectation
The registration status will remain in Pending for 7 days.
Actual Result
The registration status updates to Active.
Scenario 2
Process a new registration or registration update that requires the 7-day pending period.
Process another registration update that does not have an address change from the original from either the BMV or OVR hopper.
Expectation
The registration status will remain in Pending for 7 days.
Actual Result
The registration status updates to Active and end dates the first registration.
Scenario 3
Print VRA
Expected Result: Date Sent updates Actual: No Date Listed
Scenario 4
Process a new voter on paper.
Do not print the VRA.
Process the same voter out of the BMV or OVR hopper
The above registration auto-activates, but shows the pending paper registration tied to it.
The pending record can be auto-activated without ever sending the VRA.
Updated the precinct change check to only look at Active/Inactive registrations.

As a SVRS user
I want to add a street with a Non Traditional Street type and have NOTHING show up as the street type on the correspondence
So that mail is delivered correctly via USPS.
AC: When Redistricting is running, adding a New Street with the Street Type of Non Traditional Street (NTS) and assigning a voter to that street will not show the "NTS" abbreviation in the Voter Registration details
Currently while redistricting is running, if a new street is added with the Street Type of Non Traditional Street the NTS abbreviation will be added to the street name. This will show in the Voter Registration and if a voter is then assigned to that street the "NTS" will be displayed in the voter's address, for NTS streets this should be blank
NOTE: This is only happening in Redistricting
Login as a county user
Run Redistricting
In Maintain Streets, add a new street with the Street Type of "Non Traditional Street"
Create a new voter with the new address just made ("NTS" will be displayed here too)
View the newly added voter and check their address
Address will show the "NTS" abbreviation

Tarrant County.
Attached is the exemption file prepared by their IT team.
We have received a question concerning the (2024 -2025) jury list reconstitution created for Tarrant County.
So far for January 2024, county states have summoned 385 jurors with felony convictions.
Is there any way to verify the 160,852 felony exemptions were excluded from the Tarrant County list?
Below is from the Jury Mgmt CDW:
Below is the required information for three felon voters. Let me know if you need anything else.

In Taylor County, there should only be Congressional district 1, currently there are districts 1 and 2
From the Monday Board:
We discovered that Taylor County is showing two Congressional districts – 1 and 2. However, it should only be 2. If I can recall… the CIVIX team did the backend fix for all counties for Congressional districts, correct? If so, is there concern that Taylor County’s voters have reverted back to Congressional 1 when it should be 2?
Attached is a list of combos that need to be changed from 1 to 2. Please let me know if you have any questions.
VOTING_COMBO_DISTRICTS table updated

Darci Initially reported on 1/25/24 that a payment was made but it didn't update in the system. This was for Oklahoma Credit Union PAC ID 7618. - Receipt Attached. Since this was the only one reported, and she had updated it in the application, I ask her to watch it, and let us know if it happened again. At that time others had been paid and the system had updated correctly.
Received another email today. Another payment this time for Lobbyist Registration Fee that processed, but did not update in the system. This one was for Lobbyist Megan Oftedal ID 11397 & Principal Educational Quality and Accountability, Office and Commission of ID 107291.
For both of these, I see in the database that the call was made to the payment gateway, but no response was recorded from the payment gateway afterwards. My best guess is that perhaps the user closed the browser without returning to the application after paying.

Request from Garrick Frunz -
Redaction request from Regina Rodriguez, a federal judge who
has made contributions to various committees. Will you please redact the
following address from the 14 transactions in the attached spreadsheet:
9400 E. Jewell Circle
Denver, CO 80231
Please replace the address with:
Redacted by SOS
Redacted by SOS, CO 99999
I should also note that there is another individual named
Regina Rodriguez in TRACER, but her transactions should not be redacted. Only
the transactions with the above address require redaction.
Also, if it’s possible to conduct a system-wide search for
the above address, will you please let me know if it appears on any other
transactions or filings? I provided the filer with searching instructions and
conducted my own review as well, but I would really appreciate an internal
search if possible/practical.
The redaction was completed with the following script. The client has been notified.

During redistricting with overlapping segments. A voter in the blank range segment will move into a segment with a different combo and precinct, rather than the street segment with the same precinct and combo.
Below shows 3 street segments all with voters. The 1st and 3rd segment in the grid share the same combo and precinct, while the 2nd segment overlaps with a different precinct and combo.
First segment has a voter that falls with-in both street segments but shares the same precinct and combo as the 3rd segment
Redistricting - Maintain streets - the 2nd segment, combo and precinct is edited below to any other precinct and combo.
After confirming the changes in
"District Management> Redistricting> Maintain Voting District"
we see that the voter in the first segment has moved to the second street segment with a different combo and precinct, instead of the 3rd segment with the same precinct and combo.
Prerequisite
Log in to WV ems as a county user
Navigate to District Management > District > Street Information
Select an "Existing Street"
Have one street segment with a low and high range. Have another street segment with blank ranges but have the same combo and precinct as one of the street segments. Have a third street segment with overlapping low and high range, but a different combo and precinct. EX. Screenshot
Include a voter in the empty low and high segment, to have a street number that falls with-in the low and high range of both of the other segments.
Steps to reproduce
Navigate to District Management > Redistricting > Maintain Voting District
Start redistricting
Wait a minute and click on the "Refresh" button until grey buttons are blue.
Click on the "Maintain streets" button
Select the "Existing street" where user created the street segments
Edit the street segment that has the
different
combo and precinct
, to any other combo and precinct and update.
Navigate back to "District Management > Redistricting> Maintain voting District" and select "Confirm"
Once that has been processed click the "Complete" button
Navigate back to District Management > District > Street information and select the "Existing Street" the user has been using
Navigate down to the grid and view the street segments and observe to see where the voter from the blank segment has moved to.
Expected result
: Voter from blank high and low segment will be moved into a street segment with the appropriate low and high range, with the same precinct and combo.
Actual Results:
Voter moved into the appropriate low and high range with the incorrect precinct and combo.
​
update: Voter is moved into the second street segment regardless of the combo and precinct numbers.
Added condition for county precinct and combo while redistricting happen after street segment updating.

I want to Be able to print acceptance letters
So that I can give them to voters
Issue:
For two DMV voters (voter IDs below), the Acceptance Letter did not generate from the Final Activity screen. The letter is now not available in Batch Prints or on Correspondence History
AC:
1. Acceptance letters can be generated from Final Activity screen
2. Acceptance letter is shown in the correspondence history when it is generated
3. Acceptance letter is shown in Batch Print if it is not generated
This was seen in Prod, not reproduceable in lower environments
Printing from the final registration screen causes an error and no acceptance letter to be generated,
the letter is not available in Correspondence History or batch print
From the Monday Board:
Tucker County noticed that some acceptance letters are not generating. When she completes the registration she typically prints the letter immediately from the final screen, but she was seeing an error that the document couldn’t load. (Apologies – she did not catch the exact phrasing, and did not get a screenshot at the time).
So she went to batch print instead, and she is seeing that all other documents appear, but NOT the acceptance letter. This has only happened twice so far, and both were new applications from the DMV.
Richard Stanley Poling, 100990228 (registered 2/5)
John David Shahan, 100991910 – (registered 2/16)
I found the other voter! His name is Richard Stanley Poling and his voter id Is 100990228 and I received the application on 2/5/2024. But his acceptance letter is not in the batch prints.
Along with the voter today, whose name is John David Shahan and his voter id number is100991910.

If a former employer chooses to authorize a new lobbyist, the date indicated on the old lobbyist authorization form will be modified to correspond with the earliest date of the amendment in NM-QA. Nevertheless, in PROD, it modifies all lobbyist authorization forms to the most recent date.
Environment:
NM-Legacy-QA/PROD
Steps:
WOB of an old (2-year-old and 1-month-old) employer.
Amend the employer to add a new lobbyist
Then accept the employer
Look at the authorization form on the lobbyist tab and in View Registration.
Expected Results:
The signature date of the existing and new lobbyist authorization form should not change.
Actual Results:
In QA:
the new lobbyist authorization form changed to the same signature date as the existing lobbyist.
In PROD:
All lobbyist authorization forms change to the latest date (today's date).

This is a follow up ticket to
#64254
. The system currently allows for the date to be set to dates far in the past, where it shouldn't be allowing anything outside of the same calendar year.
Investigate source of previous bad data (01/01/1900), prevent entry of similar bad date
AC: As a county user, I would like for the system to not allow an ABBM application to have a year accepted other than the current calendar year, so the records for a voter will be accurate.
Closing this out. This was not an issue with our side, but Denton county was sending bad data.

From Dave:
For CITIZENS FOR VOTER ID (ID: 21BQC10003) I amended a
transaction to remove an expenditure and then paid off two unpaid bills
equaling that amount. Previously the 2023 Annual filed on 1/31/2024 had shown
the bills as still unpaid. But then after I filed the amendment (on
2/15/2024) to the 2022 Post General, it also changed the initial filing for the
2023 Annual and now there is nothing listed under Schedule D Section2 as unpaid
in that initial filing.
The problem was that the balance calculation for filed unpaid bills was including all transactions (payments, forgivenesses, updates) filed on reports with earlier period end dates, but it needed to exclude those transactions that were filed after the given report version was filed. There was a similar problem in the balance calcuations for loans, pledges, loans made, and pledges made, and those were also fixed as part of this bug.

Grimes County - Redistricting / NEEDS to COMPLETE
DEV NOTE: investigate why it is stuck
In progress since Thursday 2/15
Grimes
county confirmed redistricting on Thursday morning and as of today it
is still in progress. She would like to finish the redistricting
process:
After looking at the data, the last step of the "Complete" job was completed and data is updated accordingly.
But for some reason,
the status was not updated to "F" (
which is not not clear from the logs), so had a data-fix to update the flag to "F"
Analysis: -
Stored Procedure for "Complete" job is ??
offline County will call -> RED_REDIST_OFFLINE_COMPLETE
not Offline County
will call -
>
RED_REDISTRICT_COMPLETE

This issue was reported by Brittany as an Urgent Issue -
She ask for an update. There was no update. It had never been reported to Civix. Missi K thought she had sent it but then said she had not. The issue is with the balances of the Jefferson Co Republican Executive Committee's filed 2023 2nd Qtr Report.
2023 2nd Qtr Report - Beginning and End Bal are not correct.
After investigation, the problem goes back farther than the 2023 2nd Qtr Report.
This committee has two 2022 Primary Reports, both filed, and both contain transactions.
Checked with Becky. One of the reports needs to be unfiled and then deleted. That should force an Amendment of the other report, then Auto Amend should pick up and amend the rest of the reports that have been filed moving forward.

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to see the street information for Harrison county
so that the high range is 97
AC: Clement Street in Harrison county needs the high range changed to 97
STREET SEGMENT UPDATED

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to see the voter's mailing address in the CSV and Excel files generated by the County Voter Participation History reports
So that I know what each voter's mailing address is in addition to their residence address
AC: The mailing address of each voter should be shown (As well as the residence address, which is currently shown) in the County Voter Participation Reports for the CSV and Excel file outputs
I have added my Test results under attachment section

As an SVRS user
I want to see that voters in Harrison county are moved to precinct 1A
So that they are in the correct precinct
AC:
All voters on Stoneybrook road are in precinct 1A
All voters on Pinewood road are in precinct 1A
Voters in house numbers 104, 105, 106, and 108 or Forest drive are in precinct 1A
Voters in house numbers 104 and 105 on Kenwood Place are in precinct 1A
From the Monday Board:
In Harrison County, some voters are moving into new precinct 1A (combo 00154). I’ve attached a list of those voters with the current & future precinct.
Below are the circumstances:
All voters on Stoneybrook Rd. will go to 1A.
All voters on Pinewood Rd. will go to 1A.
SOME voters on Forest Dr. will be moving to 1A – only house numbers 104, 105, 106, and 108.
SOME voters on Kenwood Pl. will go to 1A – only house numbers 104 and 105.
Street segment updated or added, voter district updated, and audit record inserted for affected voters.

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to have matching numbers of voters in the Alpha report and the VR report
So that I know all the voters are in the correct precincts and accounted for
AC:
The voters belonging to precinct 11 should show the correct precinct when they are searched, not just when viewing the specific voter's voter record
For this issue, they are finding that some voters appear properly on reports and when viewing their individual voter details… But they are not appearing in the correct precinct when first searching the voter. The clerk is an example – when first searching 001006657, she is incorrectly in precinct 12 when she should be in 11.
But when I view her record, her precinct number is correct:
Incorrect precinct shows in Vire voter information

This is working correctly on UAT
There were 3 different issues reported and all 3 issues are
now resolved
after all 6 online
nodes restart
.
Root cause
: The cause of the issue was, because Application
auto restart
after the patch had server side cache issue, which was cleared with manual restart done now.
More detail
: Machine restart after the patch had some services "failed" to restart, which were all addressed yesterday. but then ENet application service did not fail, but did not start clean and booted with invalid server side cache. So application was mostly functioning but was failing in areas were we had recent (last couple of months) changes...
This is all been now noted and will be part of our system maintenance procedures and checklist going forward. (Part of "Texas Patching Post Mortem" meeting next week).

The Ballot Type option of “Early Limited” is not appearing in the dropdown for the
Single Voter Participation

KH: The counts on the
Early
Voting pages
are still incorrect. They should match the ENR Public Portal.
These are the ones that should not have been updated after February 16
th
when we ran the reports.
TE Update - I checked the Democratic primary as well and it all checks out on those totals. I also inspected the ENR page for this primary, and everything is fine. We only need the totals updated for the Republican EV page.
While updating counts as per the pdf report, R election was missed, so EV page counts for R were not matching.
Data-fix is now applied, and the job is run manually to show the correct counts. (This job is schedule 3 time a day) - Run Stored Procedure "WEBPAGE_EARLY_VOTING"
Data-fix PR is attached to
#65047

The attached document lists the races that include partial races.
On the “Click for Details” screen, these counties should show the voter
registration for the district/race. I see that the ENR Public Portal is
pulling the voter registration for the partial races as it has
previously. However, I have also noticed that
non-partial counties
are also pulling a voter registration number. For
non-partial county races
, the voter registration number
should match the voter registration number of the report
I provided that was pulled on February 16th. See example below. If you have questions, please let me know.
Example from the Republican Primary:
The race includes:
Harris
(partial) –
showing 237,254 voters registered in district of total county voter
registration of 2,611,025. (We have no way to validate so when trust
Civix has number correct.)
Montgomery
(partial) - showing 205,430 voters registered in district of total
county voter registration of 431,434. (We have no way to validate so
when trust Civix has number correct.)
Polk
(whole county) -
showing 42,831 and should show the same registration from the report of 42,825.
San Jacinto
(whole county) -
showing 19,835 and should show the same registration from the report of 19,848.
Walker
(partial) showing 12,711 voters registered in district of total county
voter registration of 37,073. (We have no way to validate so when trust
Civix has number correct.)
For
non-partial counties/races or “whole” county races, the voter
registration number must match the number from the report provided and
the registration number of the county tab for the entire county.
We are on the right path where the partial counts are using the correct logic, but non-partial races are showing a slightly different number than what is on the spreadsheet/ other parts of the site. For example, US Rep 8 on the republican side for Polk County - 42831:
President - Polk County 42845
Code change to fix the order... and Data-fix for Non-Partial voter counts to match the PDF.

Primary Election is not appending for the Annual Abbms.
The

Appears the logic is not looking at the dates in the election calendar

CFIS Filer:
24844, and more attached spreadsheet from Julie's query.
Filer was able to inactivate their PAC account with outstanding fines or negative balance.
Example:
Actual Results:
Update details and mark account inactive with fines and fees still assessed and negative balance. This is not reproduceable, but we need to determine why the system would have let the filers on the spreadsheet inactivate.
Expected results:
Update details to inactive should not allow when fees and fines are still owed. The following screenshot is from PROD with (ID 206994 candidate account) This account had fees and fines. It would not let me mark it inactive.
We need to determine who marked these filers on the spreadsheet inactive and why the system allowed it.

Debra Hicks, with ID 462130, attempted to file one of their upcoming tasks but encountered difficulties and could not proceed with the process. QA attempted to reproduce the steps but was unsuccessful. Also, Julie was unable to identify the exact problem that prevented this filer from submitting the report.

Per your
recommendation yesterday we asked the county to upload these voters
again as it was thought the restart of the system on the weekend most
likely solved the below issue.
FYI, county sent a VRU file with these voters again and they are still receiving the same error message:
Invalid Mailing Country
Below is the error message from TEAM.
VUID #1056856726 belongs to Tricia Hester this is her SC91 record
Tricia Hester and Darlene McGee both have SC90 records in our system but they have no VUID # is TEAM
Dev analysis's is completed, We didn't restart the after server's patch work, Please ask county resend the those records again. We are enable to reproduce in local also.

Data condition found when fixing
#64092
A given employer/lobbyist relation set of data should have 2 LobbyistClientID values...
one from when the Employer sources the record and
one from when the Lobbyist sources the record
The LobbyistClientID value for the Employer sourced records should not change; similar for the Lobbyist sourced ones. However, for this pairing the LobbyistClientID values for when the Employer sourced the relationship detail did change... and it changed from 4240 to be the LobbyistClientID of the Lobbyist sourced record, 3396.
For now, I'll run the script below to put the same values from the 4240 records onto the 3396 records which are sourced by the Employer; however, this will happen again if the root cause which created this condition is not fixed.
Please refer to the 02/27/2024 note on
#64092
for more details.

I want voters in Fayette county to be merged correctly
so that they are merged from municipal precinct 12 into municipal precinct 11
AC: Combo numbers 46, 58, 64, 75, and 77 in Fayette county are in Municipal precinct 11
From the Monday board:
We know Fayette did a merge recently of 12 into 11 (CPR,) but they found that we need to change the municipal precinct as well. Could we please have the below combo numbers edited so that the municipal precinct reflects 11 too?
Municipal precinct updated audit record inserted for affected voters.

The state found an issue on the Candidate listing page (
https://candidate.texas-election.com/Elections
) for the Republican Primary, where the District Attorney, 253rd Judicial District is showing up as "Liberty County - District Attorney, 253rd Judicial District." We need to remove the Liberty County part of that.
The state Edit Office page shows up normal, and so does the county level ENR entry screen for that race. Also the ENR page is correct, so I have no idea where it's pulling the Liberty County from
.
as discussed with Vinayak and Tim, this is a data fix.

It worked today. Notes attached.

Something must have been missed in the initial setup of the NEW WV DEV environment.
Looks like the connection between the NEW DEV environment, is not communicating with the report server.
I'm not able to access any NEW Reports, Which includes Registration Forms that are created on Registration, Admin Reports and Financial Filings. I can see OLD Financial Filings.
Reports in Dev are seem to be working correctly now.
Thanks
@Erik Pyell
datasource definition for SgWvEthD in troubleshoters/ folder was wrong.
Registration report issue is caused by sproc differences between our code and Wv db, missing
usp_Public_Get_CommitteeDetailsByVersion.
Other reports likely similar problems (this function gets shared) and I can generate reports directly in SSRS from the SgWvEthD server without issue

The termination problem was discovered while performing UAT Smoke Testing. The termination window failed to display the names of the client and lobbyist when attempting to
terminate
them. Also, the client authorization date is missing from the window. The lobbyist records the client's information when they add them, either during registration or through an amendment.
Environment:
UAT/QA
Steps:
Register a lobbyist and add an existing client
WOB of client/lobbyist or as a filer
On the client dashboard, click the action menu and click on Terminate
Expected Results
: In the Terminate window, the names of the Lobbyist, Client, and Authorized Date should be automatically filled in.
Actual Results:
They are not populated.

To test the Fee (Badge Fee) and Fine (Late Filing Fine) waiver from u/s 33275, I assessed a fee and a fine to filer #540894. I waived the fee and the fine, and then another event log titled "Registration Accepted" created with a description that portrayed the lobbyist as newly registered.
Environment:
GA-QA
Steps:
Register a lobbyist or used an existing lobbyist
WOB of the lobbyist
Assessed a fee and a fine, then waive them.
Look at the Event Log.
Expected Results:
The system should create an Event Log for activities that occurred in the filer account.
Actual Results:
After I waived the fee and fine, an extra Event Log is created, giving the impression that the lobbyist had just registered.

Steps James took to connect to this committee he created:
From James - This last committee was a new committee. So just filled in the information. I made sure to use all lower case in my email address.
On the second page where you enter verification info, my DL wasn’t working, but the last 4 of my social did.
I’m happy to do a screen sharing session and go through the steps. I think the issue is the system isn’t adding my existing account, it’s creates a new one. Not sure why.
I could create a test campaign and see if we can recreate the problem.
We need to change the version ID.
After he is merged we need to run some tests in UAT and determine the root cause.

After working on bug
63852 an import file issue for this committee (Maine Senate Democratic Campaign Committee)
We finally got the file to import. Now the committee has filed the report, but the report is not picking up all the transactions on the report detail (SCHEDULE A) that it are showing in the Cash Contribution Total on the Summary page.
Senate Democratic Campaign Committee (ID 341)
- January Qtrly filed on 1/16/24 Contribution Summary page total not matching Schedule A (Cash Contribution total)
Summary Page shows a
Total for Period
of $303,648.20.
Schedule A has a total of 21 contributions on it, and the Schedule A Total is $130.900.00
Transactions on this report were contained in the import file for bug 63852.
The File that was imported contained a total of 298 Contributions with dates that fall within the date range of this report.
When the file was imported the Import page shows there were a total of 417 transactions found, and 411 created with only 6 skipped.
Using the Ad Hoc Report tool - I count 419 Contributions.
Of the 419 all of them have a Modified Date of 3/6/2024, With a Fled Date of 1/16/2024. The Transaction View does not contain a Transaction ID for transactions that were imported, so I'm not sure how may of them were imported and how many were entered manually.
The Committee is reporting the only transactions showing on Schedule A are the ones they entered manually.
From the Maine Admin User - Emma Burke -
It
was previewed, and it showed the summary page differently than the summary page
displays upon filing – on preview, the summary page only showed the manually
entered transactions, like the schedules do now. Upon filing, the summary page
showed all the transactions. And this report has not been not unfile and refiled.
The problem was that the transactions from the import file had a different Registration ID than the manually-entered transactions, and the stored procedures that generate the schedules take Registration ID as a parameter. (They also had a different election cycle). I thought that this might happen more frequently, but I could not find any other recent (post-2020) instances of this happening (transactions on the same report having different Registration IDs). So I opted for a data fix.

AC:

From the Monday Board:
Below is an email from Harrison County regarding increasing the High range on Jewel City Blvd (Meadowbrook). The street currently has 2 segments: 57 – 653, and 60-608.
When they try to increase the high on the top segment (57-653), they are getting the duplicate error message. I understand that there is an overlap between 57 – 608 – 653… But the 608 range voters belong in the Lumberport segment, not the Meadowbrook one. And the Meadowbrook segment is the one needing increased.

I have an inquiry about a Cabell County voter’s audit history vs. voter information. ID # is 100885499, Dax Aaron.
In his View Voter Information page above, there are 2 dates, and one blank field.
Date of Last Contact – 4/18/22
Change/Audit Date – 11/3/23
Date of Last Status Change – Blank?
These dates do not match his audit history below, so I am unsure where these dates came from.
Looking at the audit history above… shouldn’t the dates read as follows?
Date of Last Contact – 8/12/21 (New registrant added to Cabell)
Change/Audit Date – 3/28/22 (Redistricting)
Date of Last Status Change – Should this be 8/12/21 (Added as an active voter), or should it be blank since his status has always been active?
Please let me know that I understand correctly what these dates should be. And any insight as to why these dates do not match would be appreciated.

I want to see the street information for Centralia Road in Braxton county
So that the low range value is 1707
AC: Centralia Rd (Sutton) in Braxton county should have a street segment range of 1707-2977
From the Monday Board:
Braxton county mistakenly decreased a LOW value to 1611 when they should not have on Centralia Rd (Sutton). Please see the highlighted segment below. Can the CIVIX team please increase this LOW range back to 1707 so that the highlighted segment range reads 1707-2977?

I want to see combo number information in Harrison County
So that combo 00153 includes the correct Magisterial and Municipal precinct information
AC: Combo number 00153 in Harrison County needs to include Magisterial district 4 and Municipal precinct 66B
From the Monday board:
Harrison County needs to edit a combo to include magisterial 4 and municipal precinct 66B:
voting area updated.

It’s not reversed because I thought it might be that. It is
a random jumble. I watched Jenna do a batch this morning. I just tried to scan
another batch and this was the issue.
Below 1 is actually number 3
Number 2 is actually number 4
Number 3 is actually number 2
Number 4 is actually number 1
And then I tried to upload the batch and got a white screen
which didn’t upload. Jenna just had something happen to her also with that.

I mentioned this in the meeting last week. This report
that generates as part of the monthly reports process is pulling in the old
districts\precincts. It seems that there is no method to distinguish
Active vs Inactive…or something like that.
All of the districts\precincts ARE active, but they were
changed due to re-districting. The incorrect districts\precincts, when
mixed with the correct ones, are pulling in zeros for all of the stats, so it
is not corrupting the totals, but the total district\precincts are showing as
745 vs, I believe, 401.
Here’s an example of District 1:
Report is located in the menu under Reports>HTML Reports>HTML-Voters by Party and Precinct
Updated the report to only include active districts.

As an SVRS user
I want to identify the purged voter
So that I know which county the voter came from and that that county can access her information
AC: Identify which county Sarah Menendez (1/2/93) was purged from
Notes from the Monday Board:
I believe Harrison County mistakenly pulled a purged voter when trying to process a new OVR this morning due to the issue of purged voters appearing as potential matches. This is voter Sarah Menendez1/2/93, and she is not appearing in searches. They indicated that when registering her, they did a transfer from another county.
Is there a way to track down either A) which record they pulled or B) a report of purged voters that includes a Sarah Menedez?
We’ll need to identify which county she came from initially so that the county can revert her information back instead of having the purged record reflect the new Harrison information.
I have asked Jeremy to place her back in the OVR queue for tomorrow, and Harrison will mark her as a new voter I the meantime.
Analysis completed.

WE need to use UAT to triage the Production Loan Issue.
We don't have the ability to VIEW any old filed reports in UAT and that's an issue.
We Deleted a Filed Report in UAT, and then deleted a loan payment and a Loan,
Then we needed to file the report back again, and see what the totals are.
WE filed the report, but we can't see it.

AS A SVRS User
I WANT TO be able to see when a voter is flagged as challenged
SO THAT I can view or remove the challenge if necessary
Issue: I am able to select Challenged checkbox on the voter record and it apparently saves because the voter shows as challenged in Ad-Hoc. However, when changing the voter record, the challenged selection is not shown (box isn't checked). So, I can't tell that the voter record is challenged and I can't remove the challenge (need to be able to uncheck the box).
AC:
If a voter is challenged, the checkbox will be selected.
The Challenged selection can be removed by unchecking the checkbox.
this voter is "challenged" but the selection isn't shown
Log into SVRS as a county user

If you look at the democratic primary, State Rep 14 has 5 different counties listed in the contest details, but if you go to the Pres/ VP congressional 14, only Chambers county shows up. This is apparently happening on a number of different races. There are some instances where it shows up in canvass screen and other cases where the races is not showing.
Additional example: US Rep 34 should only have Cameron, Hidalgo, Kenedy, Kleberg, and Willacy county.
On the President/ VP, it shows Bee, Cameron, Dewitt, Goliad, Hidalgo, Kenedy, Kleberg, and Willacy:

So that the status is correct
AC: Change the status on the attached list of voters to Inactive

requested that Civix make them Inactive on the backend. I checked for some
activity by comparing voter data files, and I removed voters with updates since
11/20/2023
. Can your team also check for activity since that time by
reviewing the change audit for these voters? I do not want to miss anything.

CF Filer Joseph Bizzell ID 2771 is no longer in production but can be found in Test. Can you see if the filer was deleted in production?
A filer's account (2771) has been deleted in PROD, and the cause is currently unknown. Although the account is now back in PROD, we need to investigate the issue to understand the reason the account was deleted to prevent it from happening to other filers.
below id the screenshot of the filer in Test
You may find his new 2024 account 462991 in PROD. We need to figure out what happened to Filer: 2771.
Environment:
PROD-Legacy
Filer ID:
2771
Steps:
Check backend for system error
Review code to see if there is a bug
There are three different users who access this account before it was deleted.
Expected Results:
The filer account should not be removed from PROD.
Actual Results:
The filer account was deleted, and the reason is currently unknown.
N.B:
Please investigate this issue as soon as possible to prevent further unexpected deletions and to ensure the integrity of our system.
Also, See Julie's comments for more information!
Screenshots:
The Filer in the Test environment
The filer after it was reinstated back to PROD
There are three different users who access the account before it was deleted.
Through the amendment process this was removed. Unable to identify how it was removed.
an Admin user updated it twice; once for his email address and then set it back. Which flagged it amended, should never be set for the most recent user. Julie changed the flag and date and made it visible again.

While cleaning up the test data for the 03/12/2024 deployment to GA Prod... one filer could not be removed due to data integrity.
The filer had created a transaction... no big deal for data removal
and that transaction has a Payee which resulted in Member table record being created for the payee... again, no big deal this is expected to happen and filer removal script accounts for it.
BUT the Payee's Member table record has a related Person table record... here's the big deal... Contributors/Payees (Member records created for the Transactions.MemberID field to designate who either gave the $ or to whom the $ went) do not get Person table records.
So,
@Mauro Lanzisera
I need the QA team member [
who created Filer 626378 (SS VV-22) and entered the Expenditure for $66 having Payee named "SS V" (which ended up getting Member table record where MemberID = 626382)
] to supply the steps they took which resulted in such.
then, will need the system fixed so that, unless there's some new business rule I'm missing, it does not create Person table records for a Contributor/Payee created Member record.
Expected Results:
System does not create Person table records for a Contributor/Payee created Member record.
Log in to the GA prod env
Georgia Campaign Finance System (ga.gov)
Register a
Candidate's Campaign Committee
Then before filing a report add 2 transaction
For example
Contribution and Expenditure
On the expenditure Create a new Payee
first screen shot
second one
With those two transactions file the report.
This is how you repro the bug in prod
Had to decouple the creation of a person record when inserting the payee member record in API code.

Editing fines for Angela Moore (Filer ID 58082) to waived has them still showing up with outstanding amounts on the public page as well as the Fees/Fines tab on their Filer Dashboard page
Add a fine to a filer.
Verify that the fine shows as outstanding on the public page for that filer.
Edit the fine
Set the status to Waived and set the Waived Date
Save the edits
Expected Results
Public site should show a waiver record for the waived fine and the current balance on the fine should be $0.00
Finer Dashboard Fee/Fines tab should show a waiver record for the edited and waived fines.
Actual Results
Public site shows the original amount of the fine as the outstanding balance and does not show a related waiver record. (Fig 1)
Filer Dashboard Fees/Fines tab does not show a waiver record for edited and waived fines. (Fig 2)

I want to see the voters in Harrison county moved
So that they are in the correct combos
AC:
Voters in combo 00080 (precinct 74) need to be moved to combo 00081 (precinct 74)
Voters in combo 00129 (precinct 82) need to be moved to combo 00081 (precinct 74)
Notes from the Monday board:
2,010 voters in Harrison County combo 00080 (CPR 74) need moved to combo 00081 (CPR 74)
82 voters in Harrison County combo 00129 (CPR 82) need moved to combo 00081 (CPR 74). I’ll note that they have done away with CPR 82, and it can be deleted once all voters have been moved to precinct 74.
Attached are alpha lists indicating which voters need to move. However… When I pulled a combo list, I see that combo 00129 does not exist. Why do voters from combo 00129 appear on the alpha report if the combo does not appear on District Mgmt > Districts > Combo Numbers?:
Voter's district updated

level mapping. He has the candidate Bradley (Brad) Polk running for
multiple offices. Delaware County Republican Convention Delegate, District 2 -
Republican Party, Precinct 47 Republican Precinct Committeeman - Republican
Party, and Delaware County Treasurer - Republican Party. When you map
each candidate to the correct office and save then check your work, all three
switch to the Treasurer office.

deplyment issue

Note: This is a blocker for 32924
Issue: When the user selects the Early Voting Location checkbox and saves a poll place, the Available/Unavailable status of the poll place is deleted in the DB. However, this is not shown in the UI... the poll place still shows as available even though there is no value in the DB.
AC: The poll place will retain the Status value when Early Voting Location is checked and saved. (QA NOTE: THIS WILL REQUIRE DEV ASSISTANCE TO TEST)
Repro Steps:
Find an existing poll place that has Available Status (A in the DB, will require Dev assistance)
Election Management > Poll Places > Maintain Poll Places > select the poll place > Select Edit from action menu
Check the "Early Voting Location" checkbox
Click Update
Check the poll place in the DB to ensure it still has Available status.
(A in the DB, will require Dev assistance)

Logic has changed. Needs to be fixed asap. I am available to meet in Teams anytime.
When
a user enters an Annual Ballot by Mail (Disability or 65), the system
is forcing the user to select a Party. We fixed that issue before as one
of the Rejection Reasons for an application is “No Primary Party
Preference”.
This is happening in PRODUCTION and in TEST.
User enters Annual application
All of the elections in which the voter is eligible to vote append automatically
Then, user manually goes back into the record and adds the “No Primary Party Preference” rejection.
If voter does not specify the party then system should allow
user to enter Annual and then proceed with adding manually a blank election
name and reject for no party which they will cure and then update with the
correct party.
If voter specifies the party then they will need to select
the party from the dropdown to be able to have it appended to the election.

As as a SVRS user
I want to be able to register a new voter
So that the Status Reason drop down menu has the correct options
AC: The Status Reason drop down should show all the options (eg. Paper application) when registering a mail in voter, or any voters without verifications
NOTE: Tied to site id location, shows correct options with In Person with Verification, shows incorrect with In Person Without Verification, same for Mail In
Notes from the Monday Board:
Below is an email from Hampshire County. When she was registering a new voter (100993927), the Status Reason drop down menu did not give her the option to select a paper application. When Tammy enters the below information into the system (PII is redacted here), the only option she is seeing on the Status Reason dropdown menu is OVR Import Update… And she needs to select paper application.
I tested in UAT by entering the information in her screenshot below, and Iam able to see all options. The issue seems to only be in PROD.
@Amanda Nichols – This is similar to something we worked through with Cabell, except in their case, they were cancelling a duplicate and the menu was showing new registration types instead of the cancellation types. Ticket is linked here in case that will be helpful (https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/753893993/pulses/6056527852). What was the remedy for that issue? I’m hoping maybe that resolution can fix Hampshire’s issue.
When we receive an application from the mail and/or agency, we are not given the option of choosing 'paper application' for the Status Reason. We just get the 'OVR import update' option. Should we not have more options here?
Log into SVRS as a county user.

From Kristi:
The Democratic Party has certified the primary. We will not
process the results until the Republicans are finished. However, I looked at
the screen in preparation. For every race, the candidates are listed multiple
times. (Repeating) I have never seen this issue before but we must be able to
process Sunday afternoon.
Additionally, the president/vice president by congressional
district races should not processed or included in the runoff. We need them
removed from the processing screen.

Callahan county is seeing the same issue as Reeves county where the Republican Primary can't be certified due to a race not showing up:
The fix will probably be the same as Reeves where we need to tie a candidate to a blank election.
Data-fix applied.

The below is what was discussed in the call this morning. You were going to check on TEAM and ENR Portal to make sure that for the PARTIAL RACES precinct reporting for each of the counties involved do not show 0 of # precinct reporting. In the example below, for Crosby, it should show 5 of 5.
A second example is for US Rep 7 on the Republican Primary:

WV New DEV different than Replicated PROD and Current PROD on Reporting Activity page
Reporting Activity. There were several issues with the performance of the application once several transactions were entered into the system. The pages would not load. It was discovered that there was an issue with this Reporting Activity grid, as it was loading EVERY TRANSACTION, for every election cycle. A Change was made to this Reporting Activity grid for Maine, to help elevate the performance issue. Only a few transactions were loaded at a time, and a link on the bottom was added to
VIEW MORE
transactions.
The Reporting Activity section in WV looks like the one in Maine. Wondering if this was updated to eliminate an issue with speed. Zach is the one that worked on this for Maine, he may remember more about that grid. I think Parker ended up working on it as well.
In NEW DEV - The Reporting Activity shows a Running Total of All Transactions. Transactions are displaying in the Reporting Activity Prior to a report actually being filed.
In Replicated PROD and in PROD - it shows Account Summary broken down by Transaction Type, but totals are not being displayed if the report has not been filed. (Not of much use!)
There are also two Sort By Option buttons here that are not displaying in current DEV.
RUW FE 04 (Attached) - Shows Running Total like is in DEV. This must have been updated sometime after implementation. BR $ Does indicate "When an Unfiled Transactions is edited, the edited version replaces the original version in the Reporting Activity list". This would indicate ALL Transactions should appear in the Reporting Activity, and not just FILED Transactions.
Dev needs to be updated to match the Replicated PROD and PROD version.

PFDS Filers who have filed in multiple filing years are not appearing on the Explore Financial Disclosure Statements Filers data grid when the filter is set to each year for which they have filed a statement. Jonas Armstrong has filed in 2023 and 2024, but is only displayed when filtering on 2024. Other examples can be found as well such as Shammara Henderson.
The fix here will require redesigning what data is displayed and what filters can be used to find that data. The current filters and columns displayed are a mashup of filer data and report data.

I want to know which DMV record was sent to Brooke county first
So that I can send the one with the correct driver's license number to Brooke county
AC: Verify which DMV record is the most recent
Notes from the Monday Board:
Hancock County sent 2 DMV records back to the state this morning, as they should be in Brooke County. When looking at the list, the records are for the same voter – Jyde Yeager. The information is all the same, except for the driver’s license number. Can someone verify which record was the most recent one? They are both dated 3/20/2024. We are unsure which record we should send to Brooke County, and we want to ensure the one we do send is the most recent.

Committees are assigning treasurers to their account, but they are not able to get logged in. Logging into the committee as an admin and clicking on maintain users, they are not assigned the role as a treasurer. We tried to link them through having trouble logging on the signing screen, but they are already associated.
Committee: Eaddy, Sonia for Baltimore City Neighborhoods (CCF ID: 01015231) Curtis Eaddy is the treasurer, but is not able to login. His username is otasteandsee09@gmail.com
Sonia Eaddy is the Candidate and Chair of the committee so her name should be there on Maintain user as Candidate and Chair not Curtis Eaddy. SEB can not change this information. and Park needs to change that at back end since I can not do it.
This is what it is on View Edit Committee:
This should be exactly same in Maintain users.
It is not. Need to determine why the name is not on the right user and why Curtis is not showing the treasurer role as his role. Because of this they can't get logged in. Also Curtis email is wrong on registration it should be

The state reported that there are multiple counties showing 0 for their election day totals. Need to run a procedure to fix this.
The issue is due to query which select list of elections in the procedure (WEBPAGE_EARLY_VOTING_ELECTION_DAY) which runs to update the election day voting is missing both primaries.
Stored procedure :WEBPAGE_EARLY_VOTING_ELECTION_DAY
Query in stored procedure:
SELECT distinct e.id_election ,e.dt_election FROM ELECTION e WHERE e.CD_ELEC_TYPE IN ('GE','PO','RU','SE','SU','SR') and e.CD_ELEC_CATEGORY in ('SW','PS')
and e.FL_OPEN_TO_COUNTY='Y' and e.ID_TOWN IS NULL and trunc(e.dt_election + 1) = trunc(sysdate)
Need to hard code the id election value to both primaries so that procedure selects both elections and election day voting will be updated in the ev page.
Updated query:
SELECT distinct e.id_election,e.dt_election FROM ELECTION e where e.id_election IN (49666 , 49665)
As per state , counties will be sending election day numbers till April 4th and ev page should update those numbers through stored procedure.

So that the voters are in the correct precinct
AC:
Combo 00106 (Congressional 0002, Delegate 0051, Senator 0013, Magisterial Western) is currently in Precinct 48 and should be precinct 44
Combo 00107 (Congressional 0002, Delegate 0051, Senator 0013) is currently in Precinct 48 and should be precinct 44
Precinct 48 should be deleted after the voters are moved
From the Monday Board:
Monongalia County needs to move all precinct 48 voters into precinct 44. Below is the combo information, and attached is the list of voters who will be moving to precinct 44.

Possible solution to put restrictions in place so users cannot enter a dash and alphabetic combination as a Municipal Precinct value? (further discussion needed)
Issue:

NOTE:
This is only an issue with Municipal Precinct and only with a combination of a dash and alphabetical characters (e.g. 20-A). Any other combination such as 32-1 or 33T is working fine and not causing an issue

There is an email stuck in the email queue that has a null email address. We need to fix the underlying issue that caused it to be put in the email queue with no email address, as well as fix the email process to change the status to "Failed" in this situation.

Greg and I followed the
balance transfer process whereas we created an expenditure on the older CF
account and filed a final report to inactivate the user with a $0 balance.
We then entered the balance transfer as a
contribution on the new 2024 account for the same filer.
The amount is showing up as a contribution
rather than as the starting balance of the 2024 1
st
primary report
as expected.
This is an issue with all
filers that had a transfer balance to a 2024 CF account.
I noticed that the balance from the 2022 account was added as a balance transfer in the contributions section.
I was expecting this amount to appear on the first page.
When all candidates made the transition from the 2020 to 2022 election cycle, the final balance from the 2020 season carried over to the Opening Balance field of the First Primary report for 2022.

Attached is a list of voters without precincts from the voter data file (3/18/2024), and this was shared with the counties on 3/22/2024. There were 131 voters in this file, and upon review, we found that all voters had precincts except for 3:
000013250
100424941
000013109
I’m not concerned that only 3 did not have a precinct – I’d say it’s typical for a few voters to not have one due to simple clerical errors or past issues that the county has forgotten to correct. But my concern is the total discrepancy.
What would be the reason for the voter file to show 131 voters without a precinct last week… but when we sorted through today, only 3 were without a precinct?
I will also note that today’s file includes one more voter, making the total 4/131. The voter ID is100826445. His most recent activity was 3/1/2024, so what would cause him to NOT appear on the 3/18 file, but appear in today’s 3/25 file?
I’m also adding to this thread some discrepancies from Fayette’s list of voters with no precinct. The file we sent to counties on March 22 had 879 voters, and today’s file has 33 voters.
Regarding the very last part of the issue, I did find that 100826445 has no precinct in neither the 3-18-2024 voter file nor the 3-25-2024 voter file.
List of voters attached.

CT is reporting that they are unable to access the Media ENR page after putting in the access code. I tested it out with the access code Media12 and it gives me the spinning wheel.

I want to be able to retrieve George Morrone's voter record and restart the OVR process
So that George Morrone's voter record and Johnathan Morrone's voter records are separate and both correct
AC:
Retrieve George Morrone IV's record and place the new OVR back in the queue
Revert Johnathan Morrone's voter information back to what it was before it was changed
Notes from the Monday Board:
Wayne County was processing OVR voters, and below is a printout version of what she goes by as she processes folks. The voter in question here is George Blass Marrone IV.
From the OVR queue she “reviewed” the voter and selected the existing George Morrone IV record that appeared as a potential match. She then clicked “Change Voter.” Since this voter did not have any changes, she scrolled through the registration process, clicked “Review,” and then clicked “Accept,” and completed the registration.
When she went to batch print, she could not find the documents for George Morrone IV… But she found a Johnathan Morrone with the exact same information as George. She knows this is not correct, as Johnathan Morrone was not on her printed OVR list. Plus, I believe it’s highly unlikely that two gentlemen share the same PII.
There is also a disposition letter for him:
She took a look at Johnathan’s record, and she sees there is audit history for today, but it does not say what was changed.
She was confident that she did not select Johnathan to change when first registering George, but just in case, we checked Johnathan’s record for previous name history, and found none. So that leads me to believe she did not mistakenly select Johnathan when registering George.
Now when searching, there is no record of George Morrone IV, even though there was this morning. What could have happened here? And how can we retrieve George Morrone IV’s existing record, so that our team can place the new OVR back in the queue for her to try again? Additionally, how can we revert this so that Johnathan Morrone has the same information he had before?
George Morrone placed back to OVR queue &
Johnathan Morrone's voter information updated back to the original.

If you then navigate to VIEW the only report filed - 2024 1st Quarter Report and view that report, close it, then go back to the Admin Page, and VIEW REGISTRATION, the 2024 1st Qtr Report is displayed instead of the Registration.
This happens when logged in as Admin or a Committee User.

I want to see the mailing address displayed in the absentee report
So that I know the absentee voters have the correct mailing address information
AC: The attached voters need their mailing addresses correctly displayed on the absentee report
From the Monday Board:
In assisting Monongalia with a mail merge, I identified voters in the absentee report who do not have a mailing address. (Reports > Voters > Absentee > 2024 Primary). This report is attached, and here are the voter IDs:
000596019
000599552
000607290
100383614
000612982
100276262
000725003
000673520
I verified on each of their records that the county did, indeed, enter a mailing address for these voters under the Ballot Issued tab. The trends appear to be that these all have designations of a A) Permanent Physical Disability or B) Elderly. Some are permanent absentee voters, and some are not. Please advise ASAP, as the absentee report is crucial for counties to have at this point in the election cycle.
above is the report query for the absentee report for mentioned voters from the ticket. we executed this select script in the production

Filter for report selection criteria are not correct. Committees do not register for a specific election, like candidates. We only trap Registration Date for committees.
Looks like the system is using Election Cycle, which may or may not work depending on how we fix that issue. Upon Registering a Committee, the only date captured is Filing Date.
And hopefully Committees will get assigned a new Reporting Schedule every year.
Keeping Election Y-T-D Totals calculated by even years, so the totals start over ever 2 years on the even year.
I think this report needs to be Contact List - Committees and the criteria on the report criteria select page, needs to be changed.
The 1st dropdown on the selection page needs to be Registration Year (not Election Year) and the check box, needs to be All Registration Years.

Individual Voter Report
This report is not populating all of the elections in which the voter has voted
. For example for VUID#
2163340965 it populates the voting history in Dallas which is where the voter currently resides. The voter has also voted previously in Collin county but that voting history is not populating.
The elections in the Individual Voter Report
should populate with Activity Date from “Newest to Oldest
”. Currently is starts with Oldest to Newest.
If there is information in TEAM for any of the columns in this report, it
should populate in this report as well
. In the
below
case, Party and Ballot Status are available in TEAM but not populating in the report.

The certified counties report on the ballot certification screen is only populating counties that have county offices on the ballot. It should populate all counties that have races in the may runoff election that are needing to be certified. I realize fixing the report may take some time. But, is there anyway you can run me a report of those counties that show uncertified for the ballot certification for the may runoff?

I WANT TO be able to import election history for voters and have their challenged status reflected correctly
Issue: The test epollbook import was set up with a challenged flag set to Y and a valid challenge reason. The voter history shows the challenged reason but the challenged flag shows N and the vote was counted.
AC:
Vote history will be applied to the voted as it is recording in the epollbook import file.
If challenged is set to Y in import, the vote history will be recorded as prov/chall ballot: Y (column in other voter participation and voter participation history) and should not show as "counted"
This is the file used (also attached).
NOTE THAT CHALLENGED IS Y
Voter History shows challenged: N and listed the vote as "counted" which is should not be
ePollbook import is now updating the challenged reason accordingly to voter history.
VoterElectionHistoryItemProcessor.java
: Here I am making sure the challenged and counted are set based on the challenged value coming from the import file.
electionHistory.jsp & inqvoterregdetailstotal.jsp
: Here the counted should get updated based on the challenged so made the change accordingly.

I want to be able to generate an absentee ballot report
So that all the voters have the correct mailing addresses in the report
AC: The attached voters should have the address their ballot was requested to be sent to displayed in the report instead of their residential/mailing address
From the Monday Board:
Monongalia reported some issues with the absentee ballot report. There are 17 voters in this report who are showing their residential/mailing address in the report, but their ballot is supposed to be mailed elsewhere. I reviewed these voters under Election Management > Ballots, and I confirmed that the address entered into the module is the correct one. But the report is not reflecting that address. An example is below.
Genevieve Ference, 000603614
Address in Absentee Module: 800 J.D. Anderson Dr. Morgantown WV, 26505 (Correct– this is where the ballot is to be sent)
Address on absentee report: 449 Morgan St. Morgantown WV, 26505 (Incorrect– this is the address on her voter record, not where she requested the ballot be sent)
The impacted voter IDs are below. I’ve also attached the absentee report I used, as well as notes from Monongalia County, who marked the incorrect addresses and indicated the proper address.

There are duplicate contributions. They need to edit some and are afraid edit will duplicate them again.
From the Committee Workspace - Search Bar across the top of the page, is displaying Contributions twice when related to a Fundraiser. The Contribution Page, and the Filed Report are correct. It's just the Search Results page.
Working with Chris Miller ID 136059.
Contributions - Received from Paul J Astorg.
Contribution date 2/28/2023 - in the amount of $2,800.00
One for the Primary and one for the General.
Both filed on the 2023 1st Quarter Report.
Report totals are correct.
When doing a Contribution SEARCH - using the search bar at the top of the page,
Each transaction is being displayed two times.
Note: If you amend one of those transactions again, it shows up in the Search Contributions three times. So, every time a contribution is amended and a report is refiled, its showing the transaction the same number of times.
From the Contribution page, when sorting by Contributor.
If you update one of the transactions displayed in the Contribution Search page, since it's actually only one transaction being displayed two times, it is ok, but the user needs to make sure the one they are updating is the correct one for the P or for the G.
I also amended a transaction in UAT multiple times on Christopher Miller's campaign.
it was from Joel Goldy initially for $2000,00, then 1500.00 then 1000.00. I filed the report amendment each time, and the doing a Search Contribution, I only see that transaction 1 time?
Looks like the transactions that are showing up multiple times on the Search Contribution grid, were all imported? Not sure if that makes a difference or not?
The problem was an invalid join in the stored procedure.
The stored procedure has been fixed in UAT and Production. The duplicates should no longer show in the search.

I am unable to delete a candidate loan in the Amend Transactions Module for The Cox Campaign. The candidate loan is located in the 2022 Annual filing period for $2,005.98.

Maybe this got updated to run off of election year, the the underlying code is still looking for Election Year, and Committee's don't register for a specific Election. ??

When a previously filed transaction is amended, that Amendment requires the original report it was filed on to be Amended or Refiled. This warning shows up when Save is clicked after amending the Transaction.
There is a Entry made under the Immediate To Do list on the Candidate/Committee Homepage, that shows the Report needing to be Amended. This is correct, but that same information should be showing up on the Reports>Unfiled page as well.
That report should be Filed prior to Filing any of the other reports that come after it.

I want to generate absentee reports
So that I know they display the correct number of voters with the given criteria
AC: There should be no discrepancies that are not easily identifiable when generating Absentee reports
From the Monday Board:
This issue is not priority, as we’d like to focus on the absentee tickets we discussed at our meeting today. However, we are finding discrepancies in absentee reports when certain criteria is selected.
The first attachment is an absentee report with the below criteria selected under “Reason Code” when generating the report. It shows 42 voters. When generating an absentee report WITHOUT the reason code criteria selected, there are 127 voters. What is causing this discrepancy?
Attached are 2 report criteria results
1. All absnetee ballots for a particular election
2. Excluded emergency and disabled ballot from the same report
Note: Added one Emergency and disable ballot for the election so count differs by 2 in report.

Amendment Filed of the 2023 4th Quarter Report Filed 1/8/2024.
Had an
In-Kind total of 1542.61. With the Total Contributions Election
Year-To-Date 1,325,008.84
New
Amendment added In-Kind Contributions totaling $1,424.21. Making the
In-Kind Total Contributions 2966.82. (1542.61 + 1424.21). The In-Kind
Total on the Summary and on Section is correct on the Preview. It totals
2966.82,
However,
when you take the Total Contributions Election Year-To-Date from the Amended
2023 4th Qtr Report filed on 1/8/2024 of $1,325,008.74 (Which Included the
initial In-Kind of 1542.61) and add in the new In-Kind transactions of $1,424.21
That
total is $1,326,432.95 and the Total Contributions Election Y-T-D on the
Preview is $1,331,370.42. That Diff is $4937.47
In working with the client, we found that there were two contributions that they tried to delete, but that did not delete successfully and were left in the Amended status so that they were still included in the totals but not on the report schedules. We fixed the data with the following script:
Update Transactions
Set Amended = '0'
Where TransactionID = 575496
Update Transactions
Set Amended = '0'
Where TransactionID = 575446

On the Explore Offices page, when selecting the Office Superior Court Judge for the District Blue Ridge Circuit - Wallace, the list shows that there should be 3 candidates for this race, But when you look at the Office Details page by clicking on the link for the race in the Office Name column, the Candidate Comparison tab only shows one candidate - the incumbent. There is no means on the public site or as an admin logged in to determine whether there is one, three, or a different number of candidates. See attached video for more information.
Environment:
GA Prod
Repro Steps
From public site, select Explore from the left hand hamburger menu
Select Offices
On the Filters, click the More button under Offices
Scroll down and select Superior Court Judge
Expand the display from 10 rows to 50
Sort on the District column
Scroll down to find the district Blue Ridge Circuit: Wallace
Note the number of candidates listed (3)
Click on the hyperlink on the office name for that row
Expected Result
Three candidates should be listed matching the number displayed in the results list
Actual Result
Only one candidate (the incumbent) is listed
NOTE:
Randomly selecting other races to view details of results in some that show what is expected and others that show fewer or more candidates than what is shown in the number of candidates column. The net effect is that the system
cannot be relied on to produce correct results.
Fixed to not count multiple versions of the same committee.

For all races in GA production, the data summarized on the Contributions, Expenditures, Filings, & Independent Expenditures tabs on the Office Details screen seems to be displaying information for ALL filers rather than for those candidates running in a particular race in a specific election as it was intended to do. The Filings tab also includes filing from the Lobbying module as well.
I have attached a video showing what I found.
There is a related bug
#67597
pertaining to whether or not we are showing the correct set of candidates for the various races.
Environment:
GA- Prod
Dev Notes:
5/10/23 Zach - This is a broad fix for the public site and there will probably still be specific instances that need to be ironed out. I am suggesting specific new bugs be created as issues are discovered since this bug is so broad in scope.

Click on the Contributions tab
Click on the Expenditures tab
Click on the Filings tab
Click on the Independent Expenditures tab
Select another race and repeat steps 4-10.
Expected Results
Total Contributions listed on the Contributions tab should equal the total of all contributions from step 5
Total contributions on the different sub-tabs for Contributions should all total the same
Total Expenditures listed on the Expenditures tab should equal the total of all expenditures from step 5
Total expenditures on the different sub-tabs for expenditures should all total the same
Total filings should equal the total number of filings from step 6
Filings listed should be the same as from the individual listings from step 6
Independent Expenditures tab should only show IEs supporting or opposing the candidates listed in step 5
Actual Results
Total Contributions listed on the Contributions tab are orders of magnitude higher than expected
Total contributions on the different sub-tabs for Contributions do not total the same
Total Expenditures listed on the Expenditures tab
are orders of magnitude higher than expected
Total expenditures on the different sub-tabs for expenditures do not total the same
Total filings is close to 16,000
Filings listed include Lobbying filings and filings for other filers than those listed on the Candidate Comparison tab
Independent Expenditures tab includes IEs supporting or opposing candidates other than those on the Candidate Comparison tab
NOTE
- randomly selecting races from the Explore Offices list seems to show that the data displayed for ALL races on the Contributions, Expenditures, Filings, and Independent Expenditures tabs is the same for all races. There is no evident filtering applied at all.

As an SVRS user
I want to see street segment changes made in Putnam county
So that all the street segments belong to the correct precincts and combos
AC:
Lisa Jo St (Scott Depot) s
egment 332 – 236 already exists in precinct 25-2, combo 23. 322 needs to be in precinct 25-1, combo 34 to accommodate an alpha split.
Existing street segment Bailes Drive (Nitro) 31 – 84 currently exists in precinct 22, combo 73. A new segment with the same high low range needs to be created so that it is in precinct 23, combo 22 instead
Street segment Pickens Rd (Nitro)
105-105 already exists, a new identical segment needs to be created in precinct 23, combo 22.
Notes from the Monday board:
Lisa Jo St (Scott Depot)
Segment 332 – 336 already exists in precinct 25-2, combo 23. She needs to make sure 322 is in precinct 25-1 to accommodate an alpha split. So she tried creating a new segment 322-322 (precinct 25-1, combo 34). It is not allowing her to add a segment, even though the high/low range is not the same… Only the low range is the same. Perhaps that is why.
Bailes Dr (Nitro)
Segment 31 – 84 already exists in precinct 22, combo 73. She needs to create a new segment with the same high low range so that it is in precinct 23, combo 22.
Pickens Rd (Nitro)
Segment 105-105 already exists, but she needs to create a new identical segment in precinct 23, combo 22.

AS A SVRS User
I WANT TO see absentee ballots in the county in which the requester resides
SO I CAN issue the ballot correctly
Issue: If a voter requests an absentee ballot in a county and then moves to a new county (ie the request date is before the transfer date), the request is appearing in Absentee Voter Report for the previous county and does not show in the current county.
AC: On the Absentee Voter Report, the absentee ballot should show in the county in which the voter currently resides.
Voter (
000470597)
in Marshall County requests ballot 2/26
Voter transfers to Ohio County at a later date
Absentee ballot still shows in Marshall and does not show in Ohio
This is already set up in SIT using the voter above.
Log into SVRS as a county user.
Enter an absentee ballot request with a back date.
Transfer the same voter to a new county.
Run the Absentee Voter Report in both the original and new counties. Note that the absentee request is shown in the original county but should be shown in the voter's current county.

Check-In Date should be the Filing Date. When a Report is checked in then Filed. Informaion on the Report needs to reflect information on the Preview/Filed version of the report as it was on the Check-In (Filed) date. Not the actual date the report was filed.
Working in UAT with
JB Akers ID 232340
The 2024 1
st
Quarter Report had been filed.
At the time it was filed on 3/25/2024 the
Candidate J Akers was the acting as his own Treasurer.
The Header of the Filed Report showed the Candidate JB Akers only.
The Treasure Information was blank - as expected.
Then on 4/1/2024 the Registration was amended by the candidate (JBAkers
logged in) and a new Treasurer was added.
William Wilson.
The 1
st
Quarter Report was subsequently unfiled by Admin, and checked
back in with the original filed date of 3/25/2024.
When that report was Re-Filed (PREVIEW & FILE)
– It is now picking up a Treasurer of William
Wilson.
At the time of the Check-in and the original filing 3/25/2024 the Candidate was the Treasure, not William
Wilson.

SOSOI Filer - Daniel Chuhta filed his 2023 SOSOI Report - When trying to file his 2023 Statement,
He Imported his information from 2022.
His Import displayed information from another filer.
The
Immediate Family Member
section, pulled in 2 entries that were not his.
Apparently Mr Chuhta isn't related to and doesn't know who Myrna Koonce is.
I don't have any way to search on Myrna Koonce to see who's report she was/is listed on.
He was importing from 2022.
Checking in UAT. Problem is UAT isn't set up for the 2023 SOSOI Filing.
UAT - Using the Executive Filers from below, I pulled up their 2023 Statements, and Click Begin Filing then comparing what was pulled in on that statement to the FILED 2022 Statement in PROD,
I was not able to reproduce the issue.
Unfortunately, I’m not going to be much help. I have tried to reproduce the issue in UAT using the last 16 Executive filers, including Chuhta, and I have been unable to reproduce the issue.
Of the 115 Reports that have already been filed, is this the only issue that has been reported?
We have not made any changes to the Ethics Disclosure System for quite some time, so I’m not sure what this issue could be.
I did find the entries that were imported on Mr Chuhta’s report were from Paul Saucier’s Statement. These two don’t share a computer by any chance do they?
If they do, it could be a cache issue. At this point I’m stuck.
You’ll just need to keep an eye on it for now and give us a call if it happens again. Sorry, I know that wasn’t much help!

AS A SVRS User
I WANT TO enter addresses on ballots and not have them change
Issue: If an SVRS user is updating ballot addresses on Absentee Ballots, the address that they previously entered can persist and overwrite the address that should be on the ballot.
AC: The absentee ballot will retain the address originally entered.
Issued absentee ballots for following 2 voters in Ritchie County - Patty Cox and Barbara Six
Updated address on ballot for Patty Cox to test address shown.
Searched for Barbara Six's ballot and clicked Update, Address has been changed to address entered on previous ballot, the original address on this ballot has been wiped out
Prerequisite
Voters Absentee Ballot ID# must be the same and share the same mailing address. (Pull Absentee voter report and compare same address to find pair)
Log into SVRS as a county user.
Enter two absentee ballot requests and issue them. NOTE THE ADDRESSES ON THESE BALLOTS AND MAKE SURE ABSENTEE BALLOT ID# IS THE SAME
Search for one of the ballots and enter a test address.
Update the ballot.
Search for the other ballot.
Click Ballot Issued Information pane and note that the previously entered address has been applied here. This should not happen.
Resolved updating one voter ballot mailing address affecting another voter ballot address. So issue is happening because as the voters are having same
ballot_id
, the logic in the code is updating the
id_address
of all matching the
ballot_id
. As voters can have similar
ballot_ids
. So I have made changes to query making sure that we are updating the
id_address
based on
id_election
,
id_abs_seq
and
id_election
.
This issue is reproducible when in the case where voters have same
ballot_id
.
For testing purpose we can look for voters with same
ballot_id
, and check that when updating one voter ballot address is not overwritten for other voter.

Call from Lisa Blake - WV SOS
In PROD - Candidate James (Bill) William Flanigan ID 232425
State Candidate for House of Delegates District 4
Republican.
Registered for the 2004 ELECTION - 2004 Candidate Election Cycle.
He has Contributions & Expenditures - but no reports. Lisa Blake discovered she had approved his registration for the 2004 Election, and it should have been the
2024
Election.
I did a CORRECTION on his Registration, and changed the Election from 2004 to 2024.
Then from the Reports page - I selected Manage Cycle, and ADDED the new 2024 Candidate Election Cycle.
Then I deleted the 2004 Election Cycle.
Everything looked good, except all the TRANSACTIONS that had been entered were DELETED.
Further testing in NewDEV indicated the transactions remained until the 2024 Election Cycle was DELETED.

When entering Transactions, and selecting "Candidate" as the Funding Source/Recipient the Source fields are searching for
Committee Name not Candidate Name.
Committee Name on Candidates is
NOT
a required field. When searching for a Contributor Type of Candidate, and entering the Candidate Name in the search Contributor/Funding Source field, it isn't finding the Candidate, because it's searching on the Committee Name not the Candidate Name.
Same for Expenditures - Recipient Type of Candidate, Recipient of Expenditure field is searching for Candidate Committee, not Candidate Name.
Independent Expenditures - Candidate is searching for CANDIDATE NAME. It's correct. Committee Name is not in that list.
Payment to Worker is a Name Search field for previously entered Workers only. - It's working
Loan and Debt Source Type = Self or Individual, no option for Candidate.
Just Contributions and Expenditures have the issue.

Funding Source = Candidate
Contributor Search - Search for Flanigan, Bill (ID is 232878) but you can't search for ID.
It's not finding him. If you search for Bill4WV it comes up. Bill4WV is the Committee Name, but it isn't a required field on Candidate Registration. So if the Candidate does not have a Committee Name, it's
Add New Expenditure - Expenditure Type = Monetary
Purpose = Contribution to Candidate
Recipient Type = Candidate

AS A
SVRS user
I WANT TO
generate Absentee Reports with specific Code Reasons selected
SO THAT
the correct voter ballots will show based on my criteria
AC:
All voter ballots should have a "Designation Reason" so they can show up on the report based on what "Code Reason" is selected
Issue:
Currently when creating an Absentee Report with no Code Reasons selected, some voter ballots will not show a Designation Reason which prevents the user from being able to see them if they created another more specific report with Code Reasons selected
NOTE:
The cause of this seems to be from the voters themselves and not the ballot. I have attached a file that will show a list of these voter ballots

I added report under file section

Just added a new IIEF filer in QA (Joe Blow Tester, ID: 461811) to see how the filing cycle affects the filer. Added 2 IEs of $2,000 each dated 3/29/24 and 4/9/24 both supporting Joe Cervantes a candidate for the State Legislature. adding the second IE correctly added a Report of Independent Expenditures. However, it gave the report an End of Reporting Period of 5/27/24 and a Due Date of 5/30/24. This matches the Reporting Period set up in the threshold, but not my expectation of how supplemental reports should be working. My expectation is that, since a report is due within 3 days of making the IE, the end date of the report added when crossing the threshold should be the date of the transaction that exceeded the threshold and the due date 3 days after that. This would be consistent with the client's reporting requirements for IEs. Any subsequent IEs dated after the one triggering the report would trigger an additional IE Report (or 24-hour IE Report) based on the newly added IE. So, the threshold is triggering correctly, but not setting the end date and due date correctly.
Register an IIEF filer in the NM QA environment
Authenticate the credentials
Login to QA as the new filer
Add 2 IE transactions with different transaction dates, both more than 8 days before the primary, supporting/opposing a state candidate, and linked to the primary election that total to more than the $3,000 threshold.
View the reports page for the filer
Expected Results
A Report of Independent Expenditures should be added to the filers Unfiled tab on the Reports page
The report should have a Period End date of the date of the transaction that pushed the aggregate spend over the $3,000 threshold
The report should have a Due Date of 3 days after the date of the transaction that pushed the aggregate over the threshold.
Actual Results
A Report of Independent Expenditures is added to the filers Unfiled tab on the Reports page (Good)
The report has a Period End date of 8 days before the election.
The report has a Due Date of 3 days after the Period End date.

Org ID # 232425
Contributor WVTAPAC is listed twice on the report. Date
3/30/2024 $2500.00
Only listed once on the list of contributions.
The candidate is waiting to file the report.
The contribution was actually in the database twice, but the data for one of the records was corrupt (it was tied to a registration record that does not exist). (This is the same committee that had a data corruption issue earlier this week when the registration was corrected and election cycles were deleted). Since the report was already filed, I updated the corrupt contribution to match the non-corrupt one, and will let the committee delete one of the contributions.
The script used for the update is:

Call from Gordon, that the committee (Patrick Morrisey 2024 ID 182452) is unable to PREVIEW
their 2024 1
st
Quarter Report.
The reason they are unable to Preview their report is because that report doesn't exist. There is not a 2024 1st Quarter Report on the Committee's Filing Schedule. In fact there are NO 2024 Reports on their Filing Schedule.
Transactions look like they have been imported successfully for the 2024 1st Qtr Report.
2024 Q1 – Multiple Imports as we requested, they do the last
time.
3 Files Accepted – Total of 817 Transactions.
There is only one Election Cycle and that's the 2024 Candidate Election Cycle.
Logged in as an Admin User, working on Behalf of Morrisey, from the Unfiled Reports page, I clicked the ADD NEW REPORT button.
Filled in all the information for the 2024 1st Quarter Report, and when I click to SAVE the information, I'm receiving the following error.
There are no other reports that I can see via the application for 2024, so as far as I can tell the January 1, 2024 Start Date for this report does not fall between another reporting period, start and end date.

Auto-scheduling and UOCAVA flags need to be fixed for OABA applications
Notes from the email pulses:
There seems to be improvement on some of the bugs in OABA. This record auto scheduled an M ballot (yay!), however did not insert the UOCAVA flag, and when I added it, it placed a sent date in which I still had to go delete in add/update.
It seems that Online ballots are now being auto scheduled as fax ballots, they also still do not have the UOCAVA flags, this change also needs to be made in Add/update.
Additionally, now S Type ballots are auto scheduling as M, which formerly was the only one that was functioning as intended

Reported by Lisa Blake - Richard Lindsay ID 186154 - Election Y-T-D totals on 2023 2nd Qtr Report was filed in 2023. Doubled when filed. 2023 3Q has an amendment.
Info from Becky - The committee entered YTD on the first report as $20862.73
The YTD Contributions has been set to zero and the reports regenerated.
The script used was:
Update Report
Set YTDContributions = 0
Where ReportID = 28845
And ReportVersionID = 1

Email from Lisa Blake - When candidate filed the 1st report and it was done incorrectly. It was after the filing so I was unable to unfile the report ?? He filed his amendment. But the total Election Expenditures Y-T-D are now doubled, due to him entering an Expenditure Y-T-D in the first report.
Looks like the 2024 1st Qtr Report was filed with Expenditure YTD of 663.47
Then expenditures were entered in the same amount, and the Expenditure YTD total is now $1326.94 which is correct if the initial YTD total entered was 663.47.
Waiting on verification from Becky.
Verified - Total YTD Expenditures entered for Mainella was $63.47
Sending notification to WV asking if they want us to set the Beginning ExpenditureYTD Totals to $0 and regenerate the report?
The YTD Expenditures have been set to zero and the reports regenerated.
The script used was:
Update: I should have updated all versions of the first report instead of just version one. The script below has been corrected and re-run, and the reports regenerated.

The 2024 acct org ID 215384 has an issue. The
committee returned 46 contributions that was listed on the 2023 4
th
quarter report. When you preview only 1 is showing
The problem was due to the fact that some of the information on the original transaction (e.g. ElectionTypeCode, EventID) was not stored on the returned contribution transaction, and the queries in the stored procedures needed to join back to the parent transaction record to get those values. This has been fixed and deployed to UAT and Production.

**10/1/2024 -

I updated the data to mark both candidates as Candidate instead of Pre-Candidate, and fixed the issue that kept Jeff Campbell from showing on the public site.

From Lisa Blake
Ryan Kennedy ID 232564 - Report was filed, and they forgot some expenditures. Lisa unfiled the report and the expenditures previously entered disappeared.
They reentered all the expenditures.
Filed the report.
Why did expenditure disappear?
Several different issues with the filing and unfiling process have been fixed as part of this bug.
During the unfiling process, I implemented the following logic for how to handle not-yet-filed transactions during the reporting period:
1) If there are any not-yet-filed transactions that are a version of a transaction that is being unfiled, the newest version of the transaction will take the place of the earlier version. -
Test in UAT - Lisa Test McCreary - Contribution from Mark Mitchell in the amount of $1000.00 was filed.
The same transaction was edited and changed to $500.00. Then the original report was unfiled.
Now the $1000 transaction is gone, and it has been replaced by the $500 updated transactions.
However, after I unfiled the report, the manually added report is now gone. I've tried to add new reports but I'm unable to add any reports. Becky corrected this issue, and the reports are back now.
2) If there are any not-yet-filed delete transactions for a transaction that is being unfiled, delete both records.
Have now deleted a $5000 Contribution, that was a Receipt of Transfer of Excess Funds.
Preview of the report shows the contribution was deleted.
Now going to unfile the 4th Qtr Report
Deleted Contribution that was a Transfer of Funds is now gone.
The other Contribution that was amended prior to this, originally was $1000. but was edited to $500.00. Is still showing as $500.
3) Do not delete any new transactions yet to be filed for the reporting period.
I added a new transaction of each type, while the report was filed, then I unfiled the report, and all the new transactions remained, and were picked up the next time I filed the report.
I noticed that in the case of amended reports, the unfiling process was not always unfiling the correct transactions. In order to fix this, I had to change the way RecountVersionID was being populated in the Transactions table. I have attached the correction script to change the current data so that the RecountVersionID in the Transactions table is always the version of the report that the transaction was initially filed on. (The RecountVersionID in the TransactionReports table is unchanged and continues to be handled differently than in the Transactions table). I also had to change the filing process and the auto amend process to populate this field correctly in the Transactions table.

I found that the problem was some corruption in the officer data in the Person table, including several records containing an extraneous apostrophe, which probably led to an error when those records were updated, so that the AmendedFlag was never set for them.

Set MiddleName = 'Michael' -- (formerly Michael’)
Where PersonID = 29373
Update Person

I want a query ran
to see the FPCA's that don't have a run off primary election
It appears that FPCA's aren't showing an absentee ballot for primary RUN OFF elections
We need to know the root cause of why these FPCA voters are not showing the run off primary. The FPCA ballots should have been picked up by the ABBM scheduler.
We asked lily - Should FPCA voters be treated like annual ABS voters and automatically get ABS records created for all applicable elections? and the response was Yes!

I want to be able to review combos
So that the appropriate districts are displayed
AC: The attached list of 45 voters in Morgan County in precinct 21, combo 9 should have their voting districts displayed when reviewing the combo
Notes from the Monday Board:
I found in Morgan County that there are 45 voters without voting districts, and the list is attached. These voters are in precinct 21, combo 9. When I review the combo, there are no districts.
How is this possible, considering users are required to enter districts when adding a combo? Was this possibly just due to conversion? If I can verify with Morgan County what the districts should be, can a backend fix be done?
This should be priority before the voter registration deadline on April 23rd.

I want to run the Jury Wheel file and not have Felons in the output
So that the file is accurate
AC: We need to know if these felons were not in the file TXX received from DPS last year in Nov 2023
Tarrant county
has stated that they received TX felons in the Jury
Wheel file that we provided to them on November 2023.
DPS has
researched internally and they informed us that they did not find these felons
in the DPS output files that they sent us last year which we used for the jury
reconstitutions.
We
need to know if in fact these felons were not in the file we received from
DPS last year.
Few
names to check:
I checked in
TEAM and Hall & Prater are not voters in TEAM. Stevenson is a voter in
TEAM. (This leads me to believe that probably at least Hall & Prater did
come in the DPS files??)
We need
feedback soon from Civix as this
issue has quickly escalated
in the DPS
agency.

Email from Martha Currier
This one is unusual. Olivia Watson ID Filer ID 478889 is trying to filer her SOSOI. The system allows her to import last year’s data, but when she does, nothing shows up on the Filer Details section. She was able to go through all of the fields, and file the report with the notice that it has been filed. But then she goes back to the Home page the Statement Due is still there. I suspect the issue is with the filer details section. Nobody else has reported this problem. I’ve taken screenshots and been able to duplicate the problem below.
Please let me know when this is fixed so I can get this filed. FYI – she has no information to input so it is very straightforward, same filing as last year.

I received an escalation call from Krsti regarding an issue
that had come up earlier this week. The Social Security Administration is
claiming that TX is hitting their HAVV (Help America Vote Verification) system
with hundreds of thousands of hits per week. Our TEAM system sends SSN
verifications to DPS, which get passed through to AAMVA to then hit HAVV and then
back to us.
Teja pulled data that showed out system running Live Check (our
system SSN call) for an average of ~2,000 hit per week over the last 15 weeks. This
is what Kristi expected and is in line with their volume of voters
processed.
HAVV shows TX hitting that system
for upwards of 200+k call per week over the last several weeks. In fact they
publish the data online (
https://www.ssa.gov/open/havv/havv-weekly-2024-03-30.html
).
So something doesn’t add up. DPS has a
team of technical people working to verify their system is not causing the elevated
numbers and have insisted that they only pass our calls through to HAVV. They insist
it has to be traffic coming from us. And this has been escalated to the highest
levels of TX government.
Although we provided the
data of transactions, Kristi is asking us to look into the system
further to verify IF there is some call being made by the system that could
account for this numbers.
Can we show the number of calls to and from our environment
to the DPS endpoint?
Kristi has asked for logs from DPS, but they apparently don’t
have any.
She is getting logs from AAMVA,
but I’m not sure if that will help much beyond maybe showing the DPS calls to
them.
She anticipates a call on Monday to be set up among all participants
to discuss this and has asked for Civix to participate.
TE Edit - We have approval from Kristi to make 2 changes on the system:
Call Frequency Adjustment:
We propose changing the frequency of our system's batches of calls to DPS from every 2 minutes to every 30 minutes.
Operational Hours:
Currently, the process operates continuously. We suggest restricting call times to 6AM-10PM CST.
AC -
As a user, I would like to see the timing of the calls to Livecheck to be limited and the frequency of these calls to be decreased, so the number of calls to SSA will not be inflated.
Call Frequency Adjustment:
We propose changing the frequency of our system's batches of calls to DPS from every 2 minutes to every 30 minutes.

I want to know that all precincts have their correct corresponding polling places assigned to them within the database
So that no information is missing and the UI and the data match
AC: The data should show the correct polling place of Summit Park VFD for Precinct 66B in Harrison County
Notes from the Monday Board:
Please see the forwarded email from Harrison County. The highlighted snippet below was from ES&S, indicating that the sample data they were provided does not show a polling place for precinct 66B.
I reviewed the attached alpha list for 66B, and I can confirm they all have a polling place. Additionally, I confirmed the polling place listing and see that they are all associated with Summit Park VFD.
Granted, I’m not well-versed in this sample data or know where it came from… But why would the data not show a polling place for this precinct if it is on the UI here?
This may be a question for Brittany or someone else, but any guidance is appreciated. Any issues related to voter registration, absentees, reports, and epollbooks should be top priority.

But the Registration remains.
We aren't sure what happened with this one. When Becky looked at it, neither of the registrations existed in the database around 4:30 PM.
When I was looking at it with Lisa Blake they did (Screen Shots are included) around noon. Both Lisa and Missi tried to delete them.
Then while on the phone with Lisa I tried to delete

I also tested the Reprint the Treasurer Form, both Email and Print were successful.

When I accepted the Registration, I did receive Confirmation of Final Acceptance of Registrations for both the Treasurer and the Chairperson, but never received the User ID and Password email, for either officer.

I want to see that combo 00038 in Hampshire county is deleted

From the Monday board:
Can we please delete combo 00038 from Hampshire County? There are no voters associated with this combo, but Tammy cannot delete it on her end. She receives a message that the combo is in use and cannot be removed.
COMBO deleted.

Please check into this.
County
was able to enter date 2/24/2024 as application received date. The
calendar has the by mail request end date as 2/23/2024 so the system
should have not allowed the county to enter a date past the end request
date 2/23/24.
Below are just a few examples. There are a total of 37 of them.
TE Edit - To see what is happening here, you need to go to the Elections Management section, find the selected election, and then click the calendar icon.
In the screenshot above, the ABS request end date is set to 2/23, and the county user was able to enter the ABBM request on 2/24. We need to change the logic so that a user can't add in a request after the date on that screen.
Data fix applied.

100724161 Adrea Welsh
000591490 Bruce Andrews
000596408 Ana Calderon
From the Monday board:
Brittany and Monongalia County were collaborating earlier, and it was reported that some signatures on the epollbooks were appearing very faint. Carye also indicated that the voter ID is not displaying, nor do suffixes for “Sr.” and “Jr.” (Which I’m unsure if this is a data issue, or an epollbook issue…)
Would the CIVIX team and/or @Jeremy Azevedo be able to take a look at the Monongalia epolbook voter data file on the FTP to check the signatures for these example voters below?
000593997 Carye Blaney

Grimes County, has reported 500 plus voters without a ballot
style. Upon examining the voters without a ballot style, the group
consists of mainly of voters with
secondary address unit designators
. When this has happened in the past, we have seen discrepancies in
Directional Indicators
. The images below; reflect the address line from the attached OLRV report.
Some of the voters are having inactive old street id's in voter districts table which is causing the issue. Ran procedure A_VOTER_STREET_UPDATE which will update the voters with correct street id's.
Fix applied and county was able to regenerate their ballot styles.

The ballot style #2 on the Ballot Style
report is showing precincts 101 and 103; however, the OLRV once filtered
on the column ‘Label-BS#’ for BS2, the pcts 101 and 103 do not appear.

Side note, before 8am it doesn’t, but after 8am it does.
The problem looks to be with the procedure checking for
these time records during the log on process. It was not checking to see
if the record was deleted.

Terms like "citius altius fortius" (trademarked or protected by International Olympic Committee)
Type of entity should not make it a distinguishable factor (e.g., Civix Corp should be considered the same as Civix Inc)
"911" should never be allowable in any combination of entity name

This was taken care of in other stories, so it's no longer needed
From Client:
Example, if on creation of an entity, no expiry is defined, it can be considered perpetual duration, but there must be an explicit selection so prevent perpetual duration as an error or omission of expiry.
Example, user files for a set-duration LLC, but fails to enter an expiration date. The system will create a perpetual duration entity by default.
There must be a method to notify the user that they are committing to a perpetual duration. This can be a modal, additional message, etc. There should be some sort of confirmation step for perpetual duration entities.

This was taken care of in other stories, so it's no longer needed

This needs to be a story not a bug, closing bug and creating story

After review, we've determined this needs to be a story not a bug. Closing and creating story.

Seems to be that Daniel Campbell ID 488410 is the candidate causing the issue, when they uncheck Daniel Campbell, they were able to send out all the other letters and the error was gone.
Appears to be an issue with candidates incorrectly adding a treasurer after initially registering as a candidate treasurer. Something is being done incorrectly to the point that system is prevented from appropriately handling the removal of the candidate's treasurer role.

On the Joint Contingency Fee Declaration, the form is utilizing the wrong lobbying issues. It should utilize the lobbying issues entered during PRINCIPAL Registration when you are entering the Lobbyist information (Either though Authorize lobbyist or editing an existing lobbyist on the Principal registration page).
1) Register a lobbyist in Miami and request a principal during registration.
2) Complete registration and use the token to register a principal. When you use the token during principal registration, it will connect you to the lobbyist you entered. Here, you will enter lobbying issues from the principals registration side.
3) Complete registration and approve the principal as an admin.
4) Work on behalf of the principal and view the joint contingency fee declaration from either the lobbyist grid or the principals registration. Note the lobbying issues on the joint contingency fee declaration are using the ones entered by the lobbyist rather than the ones entered during principal registration.
Expected
- Joint contingency fee lobbying issues section displays the lobbying issues entered on the principals registration when they are entering a lobbyist connection.
Actual
-
Joint contingency fee lobbying issues section displays the lobbying issues entered by the lobbyist when they are entering the principal connection.

• Fix automatic batch completion, specifically for batches created from multiple files on the same day
• Add option to complete batches directly from EMS. This should only be accessible by admins and only available for batches where the number of documents processed matches the total number of documents in the batch
From what we’ve seen, it looks like this is still an intermittent issue when batches are created from multiple files on the same day. Batches for 4/12 and 4/16 fall into this category since both files were processed on the same day, since the file for 4/12 was provided late by the DMV.
This was fixed and closed on the Monday board

DPS Files to TARRANT & BURNET counties (appear to have issues explained below)
Tim,
Can you please check the below.
Tarrant/Burnet
county have reported today that the DPS download/files that they have
received are mostly duplicates with partial addresses, and massive
amounts that belong to other counties.
(I am sending you the File name from Tarrant:

More
details from
Burnet county
:
“Our average DPS file has around 25 records in it and one of ours
yesterday had 192 records in it and only about 20 of those were for our
county and most of them were duplicates with dates from back in 2023.
“Do you know what is going on”?
Something is definitely wrong. Thought I had better speak up.

As an SVRS user
I want to mail new wallet cards to voters
So that precinct changes will be correctly displayed on the wallet cards
AC: Include the following information in a report so that a mail merge can be done
• Date of birth
• Voter ID
• County precinct
• Municipal precinct
• First name
• Last name
• Middle name
• Suffix
• Residence address (including city, state, and zip)
• County polling place location
• Municipal polling place location
• Registration date
Notes:
Since Berkeley had some precinct changes on the backend, they need to mail new wallet cards to impacted voters. Using the list of voter IDs attached, could the following information be included in a report so that we can do a mail merge for them? The order of the fields in this report does not matter.

As an SVRS user
I want to unmerge the voter records
So that no individual voter information is lost
AC: DBA will need to unmerge the voters and then we will need to send the DMV voter back to source county
Notes from the Monday Board:
Is it possible for the CIVIX team to review the DMV import from 4/10/2024? A Lincoln County voter – Brett Layne Maynard (5/16/1972) – registered at the DMV, but his record in SVRS is showing as Brett Suzanne Robinson (100209883). The voter verified the address is correct, too. At first, I thought maybe the county got things confused and changed the name by mistake, but the audit history/previous name history show no indication of a name change.
Can someone please confirm that the DMV record came in as “Brett Suzanne Robinson?” If this is possible, it should be high priority so this voter can have their record corrected and have a new registration card mailed
Based on what I am seeing in the system, the county selected an existing voter (Brett Suzanne Robinson with a dob of 05/16/1972) and transferred them from Putnam county to Lincoln county.
Do you want us to put a ticket in to have these records “unmerged” and send the DMV file back to source county?
The two voters are unmerged.

A county has reached out to us because the
regular ballots
they entered for the March Primary elections are appending the Runoff
elections even though they have not selected the checkmark requesting a
Runoff.
For Annual abbms the logic is correct, they should append even without
selecting the Runoff but for regular ballots they should not append
unless the Runoff box is checked.
example:
Regular Ballot does not have the Resulting Runoff box selected.
Therefore, it should not have appended the Runoff Election but it is appending it. Wrong logic for regular ballots.

Email from Lisa Blake
Candidate Jennifer Blake ID 216022 - Contribution dated 1/31/2024 in the amount of $31,753.45 was entered and filed on the 2024 1st Quarter Report.
IT shows up on that report correctly as Excess Funds.
The committee made a mistake when it was entered, and the amount should have been $33,754.45 instead of 31,753.45.
They edited the contribution, updated the amount. when they filed the amendment contribution is now showing up as a monetary contribution instead of a Transfer of Excess Funds.
When you Edit a Contribution, the Contribution Type and Funding Source are disabled, and you can not update that data. If you need to change that. The contribution needs to be deleted, and re-entered. Not sure how this one got changed, but now on the Amended Statement, it's showing as a Monetary Contribution. I will try to test this in the new Dev environment and see if it's still an issue.

Daniel Ankeles 481679 is not showing up in at all.
All Information form Ankeles appears to be correct, it is not unusual for a candidate to start out as a Traditional Candidate then switch to MCEA, so that's all correct. It has worked for several other candidates (to date they have paid 127 MCEA Candidates)
Not sure whey Ankeles would not appear in the MCEA Payment list.
Another Data Issue with Ankeles?

As a SVRS user
I want to see the petition history for G24Petition1 removed from the attached list of voters
So that the voter history shows correctly
AC: Voter Participation history for election G24Petition1 will be removed from the attached list of voters
Request - Remove Petition History (#1)
Good morning!
If you’ll recall, Berkeley made some errors when entering voter participation petition history, and we had that corrected with a backend fix. However, due to some turnover of their staff, two users have made the same mistake. They’ve since been informed of the proper petition history procedure, but could we please have G24PETITION1
removed
from the attached list of voters?
Election participation record removed

Please see the comments from Julie in the Repro Steps below.
#42391
fixed issues clearing Immediate ToDo items that were manually added. However, ToDo items created via the data import process are not getting fixed by the changes made for that ticket. We need to review how those are created, whether that is done correctly, fix that if there is an issue, and ensure that any update contributor ToDo can be cleared when the contributor is updated to have the required information.
Env
: Production
Filer:
205958
Filer imported transactions via import manager and accepted them. (example file attached)
Here you can see Business Type is already populated.
@Julie Spencer
provided the following additional information on this issue.
The step of the import process which creates the ToDoTask does not have the correct logic. The stored procedure being used
usp_Import_Insert_ToDoTask_Contributor calls the function ToDoTask_Contribution_AggregationAmount and in that function it is joining with the Member table to get the contributor's record and determining if it has the OccupationCode when the contributor is and Individual or that it has a BusinessTypeCode when it a different type of contributor. That would be good except it finds a record for (in our example) AFT New Mexico where the BusinessTypeCode is NULL; however, that was the first version of the contributor and not the most recent version. The function ToDoTask_Contribution_AggregationAmount needs to be updated to only look at the most recent version of the contributor record and then determine if OccupationCode or BusinessTypeCode is not there.
The function
ToDoTask_Contribution_AggregationAmount was updated to use the max MemberVersionID when determining whether or not a ToDo item is necessary. It was previously using the MemberVersionID from the Transaction table, which may be out of date with respect to the Member in question.

Lobbyist Registration form is showing the incorrect input on the form. Instead of showing the Lobbying issues entered during lobbyist registration when adding a principal, it is displaying the issues entered by the principal during their registration when accepting a lobbyist.
1) In Miami LRS create a lobbyist registration.
2) Add a principal during the lobbyist registration process and note the lobbying issue entered.
3) Next, use the token to create a principal registration.
4) During principal registration, when using the token and entering the lobbying issues for the previously entered lobbyist, use a new lobbying issue which is distinct from the ones entered during lobbyist registration.
5) Complete registration and accept the principal as an admin.
6) Go and view the lobbyist registration.
7) Note the lobbying issues displayed are the lobbying issues entered by the principal when approving the lobbyist rather than the lobbying issues entered by the Lobbyist when adding the principal.
Expected - Lobbying issues entered by the lobbyist will show on their registration form.
Actual - Lobbying issues entered by the principal are showing on the lobbyist registration form.
Lobbying Issue entered by Lobbyist during Registration > adding principal
Lobbying Issue Entered by Principal while approving lobbyist
Lobbying issue displayed on registration form for Lobbyist (incorrect, it should be issue entered during lobbyist reg not the one entered during principal reg)
Changed lobbying issue on the lobbyist registration form and demoed the change locally on 05/14/2024

The issue is that
If the import file has multiple contributions from the same contributor
AND
that contributor already existed in the db WITHOUT an external ref id
THEN
The second contribution would be added to the transactions table without a member id because it was assumed that the external ref id was valid.
The solution was to have the db update the external ref id if it is not set when checking to see if the contributor already exists
NOTE: This fix will not retroactively repair any bad transaction entries because the member id and the ext ref id are missing.

This is the file name where the county confirmed they sent the
“Bypass” live check option for a voter that has only a First Name. The
application was coming as an incomplete but county verified voter’s SSN

No action by our team. Response from Lily after comment from
@Vinayak Deshmukh
Can we bypass the live check for any record comes with only First Name and empty or invalid characters for last name ?
can we avoid, changing the business rule for a specific
county
, if possible?
Also making last name optional (null) could break the system in many areas.
Lily:
Agree. No changes. we will see at our level how else this can addressed.

As a SVRS user
I want to be able to spoil an absentee ballot
So that I can issue a new one
AC:
There will be no Oops Error on spoiling a ballot.
Enforce the 50 character limit on all "other" memo fields (add and update).
canceled
rejected
spoiled
provisional/challenged
Repro Steps:
Issue an absentee ballot then proceed with client steps:
He selected the “Select if ballot spoiled” checkbox and selecting
“other” from the reason drop down menu. In the memo field, he is entering
“REQUESTED REPUBLICAN BALLOT AFTER RECEIVING NON PARTISAN BALLOT.”
NOTES: In testing, I can avoid the oops error with a shorter entry in the "Other" memo field. The field is allowing entries beyond the 50 character limit. Enforce the character limit on all "other" memo fields (add and update).
Enforced the character limit to 50 on the memo fields for both add and update screens and also made sure that there is no oops error

Multiple messages from Lily:
TEST Environment - Still cannot run reports
We get an unexpected error. We need to be able to TEST.
Issue is due to sequences being out of date. After last data refresh from production to UAT all the sequences are not updated which is causing the issues in UAT by throwing unique constrain violated error.

They refiled the 2022 Q1 Report as needed, all reports coming forward shows as Amended on the 29th.
The problem is, the Amendments for the 2022 2nd Qtr Report with 2 amended Contributions.
2023 1st Qtr Report
and the 2023 2nd Qtr Report -
None of the transactions above were picked up, even though the Reports page shows those reports as having been amended on 4/29/2024 when the 2022 1st Qtr Amendment was Checked in on 4/7/2022 Filed.
The transactions that were not picked up in the Amendments of the reports and are listed on the Committee Home page, under the Immediate to Do, however they are not listed on the Unfiled Reports page, showing the reports page as reports still needing to be amended.
Wonder if the fix that Parker made to remove the number of Pending Transactions on the Unfiled Reports page to speed up the system has anything to do with Reports needing to be Amended, not showing up on that page, but showing up on the Home page?
I am going to check with TEAL to see if they Edited the transactions that are not showing up or they deleted them and reentered them.
I fixed the data (script is attached) and regenerated all of the reports for this committee. I logged a separate bug (71341) for the issue with the auto-amend process.

As an SVRS user
I want to find if a voter with no voting or address information is an error, or just similar to another voter
So that I know the voter information is correct
AC: Determine if this was an error either in the data file, or from the county, etc, or if this is two different, but similar voters
Notes from the Monday Board:
The voter below – Graham Nolnar (100912944) appears in the voter data file with no voting or address information. When you search him in SVRS by both name or voter ID, no results are found. However, I found a Graham Molnar (100912949) in Hancock County. Looking at this record, there is no name history indicative that the last name changed from Nolnar to Molnar.
These items on the SVRS Molnar record DO match the chart below:
Date of birth
Registration Date
Effective Date
Party
Status
These items on the Molnar record DO NOT match the chart below:
Voter ID
Last updated/change audit date
Date of last contact
ID required?
The chart does not have districts/precincts, but SVRS does.
Can someone please look into this and see why this occurred?
The voter history address (previous/past address)is getting deleted but not the assigned address as per the code found. we have the functionality of deleting the voter history address.
So no code that deletes the voter's current address from the voter address table.
I have also checked through the application as well we can't add a null address.

A member of the public noticed that the report is not showing the totals for the UCES’ Clown Party (W) and Veteran’s Party (V). It appears to show counts in each precinct but it does not total it for the house district or do a total for statewide

Notes from the Monday Board:
Hampshire has discovered voters registered in their county who are showing a Berkeley County precinct. Please see details below:
What would make this happen? And is there a way to identify if it is happening to other voters/counties? Hardy reported the same issue, but I am waiting on more information from the clerk.

As an SVRS user
I want to see wards and municipal precincts displayed when trying to input early voter history
So that voter information is displayed in the correct places
AC: Display municipal precinct and wards in the designated fields on the Early Voter Participation screens
Notes from the Monday Board:
Marshall County found that wards are not appearing when trying to input early voting history. This voter, for example, is in ward 2.
But when she was training pollworkers under Voter Management > Election participation history > Selection election > Add early voter > 100942315… The ward is not showing.
On the next screen, we see that the ward still is not appearing, and now the municipal precinct is missing
Corrected the field name of municipal precinct and Ward

This issue originates from a document that Trish, Julie, and a few testers were working on. The lobbyist filed report is also shown on the public site with link to see the PDF. According to Julie's research, these reports were saved in the CFIS network drive, under the report folder.
Environment:
Filer ID:
Steps:
Search for a lobbyist on the public site
Click on the lobbyist's name
Then click the filing tab
Expected Results:
Upon filing a report, it should appear on the public site without the link and should not be stored in the CFIS network drive's reports folder.
Actual Results:
When a lobbyist submits a report, the PDF can be viewed on the public site, and it is also saved in the CFIS network drive's report folder.

Brittany is requesting a copy of the text for both the Filing Due Reminders and the Overdue Reminders, which I have.
Documentation from ADM FE29 Correspondence for
Candidates and Committees WV.
I don't have the exact rules for the Filing Due Reminders.
The Documentation isn't real clear.
The
Upcoming Report Due Reminder
email is
generated overnight when a candidate or committee has an unfiled report in
which:
the
allowable filing period begin date is in 7 days,
or the due
date is next day.
It is only
sent if the report is not yet filed at the time the email is sent.
and wondering how this will work since the reports weren't assigned until Saturday 4/27/2024?
I will send the documentation attached to Brittany, but need clarification on the Date of the Filing Due Reminders. They might have already gone out?
The filing due reminders are sent out 7 days and 2 days before the due date for reports that are not yet filed. Any candidates/committees who did not have the 2024 Primary report already on their schedule would not have received the 7 day notice, but it looks like everyone was sent the 2 day reminder this morning.
Late filing reminders are sent out 5 days after the due date for reports that are not yet filed.
These settings are code table-driven (but not accessible through the application), so we can change them if requested.

Michelle called -
Contribution was entered and filed on CFA-11
Then the Candidate realized it was from the wrong contributor.
Initially entered on the 26th from Indiana House Republican Campaign Committee.
4/25/2024 $43,256.70 - Entered on the 26th and FILED.
Then on the 28th, she deleted the contribution and reentered it correctly.
Date of Contribution was 4825/2024 from Indiana Republican State Committee in the amount of $43,256.70.
There are two CFA-11 Reports, neither one is showing the offset of the Contribution from Indiana House Republican Campaign Committee. ($43,256.70).
When you try to amend the original CFA-11 It's not picking up the offset, and when you click to Amend the 2nd CFA-11 Filed on the 28th, It's not showing it will pick up the offset either.
I think that if the first report had been amended before the second report was filed, all three records would have been picked up, but with the new record filed on a different report, the first report's aggregate on an amend is 0, so nothing else gets picked up.
My suggestion is that they unfile and delete the first report, and then let the second report stand as is. Alternatively, they could try unfiling (and deleting) the second report and amending the first report.

Can you please check on this? It is our understanding that the
scheduler runs at 6:00 am daily however we have several counties that

Contribution is not getting picked up o n the Report Total PREVIEW page, but it is on Section 4 of the Report.
The problem was a mismatch of election cycle between the filing calendar and the committee's filing assignment. The stored procedure has been updated to take it's election cycle from the committee's filing assignment. This change has been deployed to UAT and Prod.

In the CFIS module, pagination of the grid for Notification Templates is not working. The system reports the correct number of templates in the schedule, but if that number is more than 10, you cannot get to any but the first 10 templates. Increasing the page size to 25 or 50 does not result in a change. Nor does moving to the second page with the page size set at 10.
Log into NM QA or NM UAT as an admin
Go to Notification Administration
Select Templates and Schedules
Select the "
P
AC and Candidate Filing Notification Schedule"
Note the number of templates listed in the pagination control for the grid.
Change the page size from 10 to 25 or 50
Return page size to 10
Click on the right arrow to show the second page of templates
Expected Results
Changing page size should show more than 10 templates on the grid.
Moving to the second pages should show the second set (or subset) of templates.
Actual Results
Changing page size does not affect the templates shown in the grid
Moving to the second page does not affect the templates shown in the grid

Please check the EDR date logic. These 2 voters as an example are in
Austin county have an EDR date of 5/4/24 instead of 30 days after
registration date.
TE Edit - This is ONLY happening on production. The client hasn't been able to reproduce this on UAT. The legal requirement is that the EDR has to be 30 days after the date of registration.

See Notes below from Julie
The filer registered into the same cycle (2022 Independent Committee Filing Cycle) on 03/08/2024 (date of MemberVersionID = 4) and amended that registration on 05/11/2024 then registered into another cycle (2024 Independent Committee) on 05/23/2024.
So they were in "2022 Independent Committee Filing Cycle" from original registration record until 05/23/2024 (create date of their current registration record)
BUT somehow within the dates of 03/12/2024 and 05/22/2024, prior to registering into the
2024 Independent Committee cycle, 28 transactions were created and they have a RegistrationID of the registration they did on 03/08/2024 but the cycle that was not yet in place... it's this RegistrationID/Cycle disconnect which prevents the data from being seen.

When
Creating an AD HOC Notification for political committees, The count is 302, but
the AD HOC report after filtering out independent Expenditure filers shows a
count of 306 for a discrepancy of 4. The Ad HOC notification count seems
incomplete
https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/742061987/pulses/6509804352
Environment: PROD (UAT)
Steps to reproduce:
Login as admin
Go to Notification Administration on Left Menu and choose Ad Hoc Notifications
Select 2024 PAC Election Cycle in Election Cycle
Select Political Committee in Reporting Entity
Select Treasurer in User Type
Select Active in Status
Hit Search
Note the number of rows returned (See Figure 1)
Go to Admin Reports
Scroll down to Ad Hoc Query
Select Ad Hoc PAC Reconciliation as a saved query (See Figure 2)
Export the results to Excel/CSV
Filer the results to eliminate duplicates based on the committee name and to select only treasurers
Expected Results
The number of results of the search for recipients and the ad hoc query should match.
The listed treasurers should match between the search for recipients and the ad hoc query.
Actual Results
The number of results of the search for recipients and the ad hoc query do not match.
The listed treasurers do not match between the search for recipients and the ad hoc query.
Figure 1:
Figure 2:
Figure 3:
The count after removing Duplicates and IE filers is 306 not 302
Set the AdHoc Query search to ElectionDate = '11/5/2024' AND Status = 'Active' AND RegistrationType = 'Political Committee'
Then export to CSV
Any duplicates will be because the filer has multiple Financial Institutions

Trying to delete the committee. I sent instructions in an email for Martha to UNFILE the reports first, then delete the transactions.
Apparently she didn't read them because she deleted the FILED Transactions, then tried to unfile the reports.
ALL the transactions are still showing with no way to delete them.

All Transactions were deleted when they were FILED, so there isn't a delete option on them now.

I want to know why voter 100607792 in Monroe county is marked as "Under Review"
So that I know if this was correct or an error
AC: Determine whether there was something in the record that would trigger an Under Review status and identify what the voter's status was before it was changed to Under Review for Loria Chasnoff
100607792 in Monroe county
Notes from the Monday Board:
Monroe County is dealing with an early voter who is showing as “Under Review,” therefore she was not in the pollbook. Her name is Loria Chasnoff, ID 100607792. I reviewed her record, and I do not know why she would be marked as such. Her address is valid and falls within the high/low. I noted that the “Further Action” box was not checked, if that matters. Can you confirm that there is nothing wrong with the record that would trigger an “Under Review” status automatically?
The last action was on 1/29/2024, and it indicates a status change was made on that day. Is there a way for your team to identify what her status was BEFORE it was changed to Under Review?
I’m thinking this was just a simple clerical error on the user’s end, but want to make sure we double check so that an explanation can be provided at the county’s canvass if needed.

Email came in initially from Lorrie B on 4/29/2024 - Calls from Candidates who have Reporting Exemptions (So no reports on their reporting Schedule) that they are receiving filing reminders for the 42-Day Pre Primary Report.
Daniel Hobbs, Jennifer Dilworrth and Jared Crockett.
Ask Lorrie to forward one of the actual emails.
It was discovered yesterday afternoon, that after the Data Refresh of Maine UAT, that the emails from the production data were not mask when the data was refreshed in UAT. UAT Data Refresh ticket # 70965 - IT refreshed the database. Sean didn't know the emails weren't mask when IT did the refresh.
1. Either mask the Emails in UAT ASAP or
2. Disable UAT emails
Lisa is the only one using Maine UAT right now, and turning off emails is ok!
Sean has mask emails in both QA and UAT, so no emails from either place will go out.
Not sure
Sean has mask emails in both QA and UAT, so no emails from either place will go out.
Not sure where the initial emails reported came from. All the committees mentioned in the original bug, don't have any reports on their filing schedule.

Women's Leader Fund PAC ID 4919 - Filed an IE it shows a Treasurer that hasn't been active since 2017.
Robert Carter JR has been the Treasurer since 9/19/2017.
The Committee has two expenditures to Support Hon David G Haggan, one for $750.00 and the other one for $1,025.00. Both were dated 5/6/2024.
The transactions correctly triggered a 2-Day Primary IE report.
But the Report is showing the Wrong Treasurer on the Report.
It is showing filed by Keith Herrick who hasn't been the treasure since 2017
Fixed treasurer. Both treasurers were created at the same time, seems like they tried to add a historical record? Both treasurers were created in 2024 and then one of them was marked as having an end date of 2017.

From the Committee Detail Summary Page - It shows Top Donors, and Top Payees. Click on the Top Payees, and it shows Alan Miller as the Top Payee with a total of $71,339.77

Alan Miller is not.
This was a logic issue affecting the display name, the data is OK. Alan Miller is Print Mail of Maine, with a member ID of

S A SVRS User
I WANT TO import voter history
SO THAT voters can receive history for voting
AC:
Investigate why epollbook imports are not applying voting history until they are run a second time in PROD and provide guidance that can be given to the client.
If there is an fix required, ensure that multiple voter history imports work on first try.
All voter history from the file will be applied.
NOTE: Added screenshot of error from client.
Issue: Brittany at WV attempted to import several voter history files in PROD over the weekend. Cabell and Monongalia counties files were imported (and archived) but voter history was never applied until they were run a second time.
What caused these to fail?
The client was attempting to import several at once, is this related to volume?
Fig1 - even though these were archived, voter history was not applied
Added the fix PR got merged

We have reviewed the list provided and attached & below are the FPCA
vuids that need the Primary Runoff REMOVED from the abbm module as they
should have not appended to these Federal only voters.
We need to
remove ASAP to prevent further issues.

Data fix applied to production
Data fix applied to production.

Filed report data that's generated when filing in CFIS is different than lobbying. When lobbyists filed from CFIS the data in the db contained values that are not present when filing from lobbying and vice versa. The differences in the filing logic need to be researched and documented (and bugs causing bad data opened and fixed) so that lobbyist reports in state submitted in production can be properly fixed without adverse impacts on the data.
Steps below are from the original bug, go to System Information below Repro Steps to see Julie's findings.
Environment:
GA Prod
Filer IDs:
567001, 566946, 587510
Steps:
Go to GA Prod and work on behalf of the filers listed above.
Try to view the filed/amended reports.
For 567001 try to view "Jan 1 - Jan 15 State Level Lobbying Report (Lobbyist)" and "Jan 16 - Feb 1 State Level Lobbying Report (Lobbyist)".
For 566946 try to view " Jan 1 - Jan 15 State Level Lobbying Report (Lobbyist)".
Note how the report status is submitted.
For 587510 try to view "Jan 16 - Feb 1 State Level Lobbying Report (Lobbyist)".
Note how the report status is submitted.
In addition, some users are still getting the NM LOGO. It occured 2/1/24 at 7:49am
BE SURE TO DO BOTH THE REPORT AND THE AMENDED REPORT
Expected Results:
The reports should be in status filed and open when trying to view, with client specific branding.
Actual Results:
The reports that weren't amended are in status submitted and open a blank tab or with incorrect branding.
Notes:
any report after 1/16/24 will need to be regenerated

URGENT: Nacogdoches county
Tim, (this may be statewide)
The county has identified voters
who are not part of the County Commissioner 1 district race, yet they appear on the ABBM/FPCA report for that election.
The system is appending to the voters who requested a Runoff election when the March Primary was entered in TEAM.
The
system should have only appended the Runoff election to the voters in
County Commissioner District 1 however it appended to all of the voters
below which are not in this race.
These VUIDs need to have the election removed from their record ASAP.
Please find below a list of VUIDs that should not be displayed on the report.
This is data fix, we did in production

FPCA Vuid - 2209974113 - Need to Remove the Runoff Election
Please delete the Primary Runoff from this voter. The county deleted yesterday but it re-appended.

renew filer into 2024 2 year cycle
Go to file the first report = filing page is showing the correct new beginning balances as entry fields. Do not change the values and file the report
open the filed report
Expected Results:
Since the filer is a non-candidate committee and has filed all the reports assigned in the 2022 cycle and has renewed into the 2024 cycle, when they file the first report of the 2024 cycle the filing pages should show the ending balances from the last field report in the bcb entry fields (which it is doing correctly). When the filer submits this report a new transfer balance entry should be created with the value in the BCB entry field (which is the ending cash balance from the last filed report in the prior cycle. The first report pdf in 2024 should show the ending balances from the last filed report in the previous cycle in row 2 and zero out the values in row 8.
Actual Results:
The filing page is showing the correct values on the first filing of the new cycle. However when that report is submitted the new transfer balance that is created is the wrong amount. On the pdf line 2 shows the wrong amount for in kind and cash. It appears that it's taking the ending balance from the last report - the initial BCB from first filing + the values from line 6 of the last filed report. This issue happens when the filer files the initial report with no initial bcb amount as well.

Issue:
When more than one record is saved at the same time, the Early Voting Register Count or Details report will issue the same number multiple times
Notes from AK:
This has been a continuing issue that has been reported in the past but has never been resolved. It may no longer even be in the list of bugs anymore due to the longevity of the issue. However, with the new way of saving the record, maybe this can be easily fixed.
If two users are saving more than one record for the same district and save simultaneously, the system will issue the same number more than once. For example, two voters in the same household show up together to vote at the early vote location and are registered in the same district. In processing the voters, the users select the save button at the same time and the sequence appears twice. See picture below.
Fixed with 72111

Issue: Sequence is populated after the ballot is saved, this will then show up correctly in the Early Vote Certificate pdf; however, if the user logs out or navigates away from the page any way other than clicking the Back button, (Clicking the hamburger, refreshing the page, closing the browser), they are shown the "Please select Save or Cancel Ballot" message, and then the system will cancel the saved early voter record. This will show their voter history on their record (it will not have their district number or sequence saved), and they will not appear on the Early Vote Report
Notes from AK:
While in the screen processing a voter, after the election worker saves the record, the pop-up displays accordingly stating it was successful and two (2) was assigned as the sequence number in the Seq # field and the certificate populated as a PDF upon request.
After I selected OK to the successful pop-up, I then wanted to leave the module and I selected the hamburger and received the pop-up warning stating to save or cancel the ballot. I had already saved the ballot, and in this module, there isn’t a cancel button. This same pop-up also displays when you select the Logout option. The real issue is if they improperly log out by closing the browser using the X, which I did. If this happens, the system will cancel the saved early vote record (NOTE: This does appear to be intermittent as I have had some cancel and some that did not while testing this issue).
When you view the voter’s record in Inquiry, the voter will have voter history on their record, but they will not appear on the Early Vote report.
And, when you go back into the Early Vote module and look them up again, you will receive the pop-up stating the voter has already voted. The system is properly looking at the voter history which is still on the voter’s record. However, the district number and the sequence number are no longer assigned to this voting record.
If you select the OK button displayed in the already voted pop-up, the system is unfortunately allowing the user to add a district in the District field and to save the record again obtaining a second sequence number.
When you order the Early Vote report, it now shows sequence 1 and 3 but, nothing about sequence 2 which can be rather confusing to staff when trying to do accountability
In addition, this voter NOW has two lines of voter history recorded on their voting record
The proper way for a sequence number to be removed from a voter record is to delete it using the trash can in the Action box. In this scenario, when it is deleted, the voter history is removed from the voter’s record, and it will appear on the reports as deleted. This was successfully tested and is working accordingly.

Back on the filing screen, select "add expenditure" again.
Make some edits to the data entry.
Exit and go view the reports. Note that duplicate reports entries have been created (Also in QA it seems the file button is not working)
Expected results - Expenditure editing should not create a new report. It should only show on the existing report or amended report you are filing.
Actual results - Editing expenditures is creating additional unwanted reports before you even file the report. Sometimes in QA the file button also does nothing.

Notes from the Monday Board:
Wayne County voter Glenna Epling, 002509435, is supposed to be a regular absentee voter, but it is flagging her as an Elderly/Disabled voter. I’m not sure how or when, but somehow she was marked as Elderly/Disabled:
Julie is trying to remove data from this tab, but it is not allowing her to do so. She was able to successfully enter the regular absentee after deleting the pre-populated Elderly/Disabled ballot, so the main question here is how can she remove the information from the Elderly or Disabled Information tab. She shows in the report as Elderly as well, which wouldn’t be correct in her scenario

I want to ensure that
Isaiah McCoy from Kanawha county and
Rece McCoy from Marshall county have the correct voter history
So that there is no misrepresentation of potential double-voting
AC: Voting history for the 2024 Primary should be deleted for voter 100862471
Notes from the Monday Board:
Below is an explanation of a voter mix up in Kanawha and Marshall. In short, Marshall pulled the wrong voter when processing an OVR. Kanawha pulled the voter back, and Marshall is going to re-process the proper voter today.
Can we please have history for the 2024 Primary deleted for voter 100862471. It is not showing the 3 dots for Kanawha to delete on their end. If possible, can this be prioritized so long as your team is not tied up with major fixes/work at the moment? We want to ensure that there is no misrepresentation of potential double-voting, as this was a simple mistake on the county’s end.
Unique situation. Isaiah McCoy – a Kanawha Voter – called to verify his registration. I found that Marshall had mistakenly pulled him over during an OVR registration. They were trying to register a Rece McCoy but pulled Isaiah instead. They should have registered him as a “new” voter instead of a “change voter.”
I let Isaiah know we’re on it, and he is prepared to vote on Tuesday.
As normal procedure, I instructed Kanawha (Greg) to pull him back since he was duly registered before the deadline, back date the change, and he will make sure he appears in the Election Day books they are printing before Tuesday. But prior to pulling the record, we noticed that the real Rece McCoy already voted in Marshall County in person. Therefore, voter record 100862471 shows Marshall participation. And Isaiah McCoy (who the real record should belong to) should not have history yet, as he plans to vote on Election Day. So if we pulled him over now… It’d show double participation when it should not, since these are 2 different people.
I’m thinking we have Marshall delete the early voting history on the record for Rece, and then re-add him via OVR, and re-credit him for early voting. Then, have Kanawha pull the record back to reflect Isaiah’s information, and credit him when (or if) he votes next week. Just wanted to provide something to you all in writing should issues arises. Please let me know if you approve on the idea of correcting this matter.

I want to be able to input early voting history
So that I can process voters effectively
AC: When a voter is processed as having voted early, they should be marked as "Already Voted" without the County having to leave the screen and re-insert the voter's name to show they have already voted
From the Monday Board:
Please see the below report from Nicholas County. They are trying to input early voting history:
My first two voters, Peggy J Fitzwater and Thomas Fitzwater on 608 Spruce Street, Summersville took forever to process. I searched the first one, Peggy, and it spun for a good minute before it pulled her information up and when I marked her early voted, it spun again for a good 30 to 45 seconds and when I hit insert, it spun again for another 30 to 45 seconds and it never marked her as “Already Voted” in red. I hit the insert button again and it said she was already voted. I have to go completely out and re-insert her name in order to show that she was already voted. It has been doing this for every single voter I have processed this morning.

From Parker's analysis - It is failing to generate loans report. the most recent 6 loans received transactions do not have the lendor name filled. adding the lendor information will fix this. These transactions appear to be imported through the import manager.

Need to review import manager to ensure that if the lendor name is blank, it creates an error and doesn't let the Loan Received Transaction import.
Lendor name appears to be a required field in the UI and database and should be required in Import Manager.
Test with XLS and XML
Had to remove code from the service that had specific logic to only properly fill out the transaction if it was the first time seeing the same external ID. Anything consequently got the erroneous data.

Can't amend a lobbyist (previously authorized) to add a token principal.
Register a lobbyist and add a principal.
Authorize the lobbyist through the principal.
As the lobbyist, go and amend registration
Add a new principal (token or existing) during amend flow and save.
Note the error message when you submit.
Expected results - Lobbyist can amend registration, add a token client, and submit (user will see success message some time after submit)
Actual- After amending to add a token client, a user submits the amend and will be shown the below error message.
After analyzing and performing additional tests in the local environment and quality control, it was decided not to continue with the process and close the PBI. This as agreed with
@Jonathan Guidry

The edit registration pencil (next to lobbyist details) frequently disappears.
As an admin, WoB of a lobbyist (Has been seen in both Miami and GA)
Using the pencil, Make an amendment on the registration
Save the amend and go back to the Filer's Dashboard page.
Note that the pencil icon sometimes disappears after this series of events. User can refresh a few times and sometimes it will show again.
Expected - Pencil icon is always visible on Filer's Dashboard
Actual - Periodically, after an amend specifically, we notice the pencil disappears.
SharedService is being reinitialized during page reload, causing page to lose isAdmin and registrationID needed for getting data - Added checks to pull these from local session storage when needed.
Also removed the check for AmendPendingStatus - this is from legacy NM, and amendments are auto-approved in 2.0

On navigating by clicking a tab,

message should not display, refer to the screenshot.
Expected results:
Validation should not display and it should allow to Proceed
Fixed.

When a lobbyist terminates, the "Employed date" is missing and not selectable/editable. It also shows as reqd but isn't truly as user can proceed without it.
Login as a lobbyist with an authorized principal
In the grid, choose to terminate the relationship with the principal
In the terminate modal, note that "Employed Date" is empty and isn't editable (also it should be status date to match GA functionality). It shows as required.
Fill out all other fields and submit terminate.
System allows you to proceed but termination doesn't seem to go through as no doc is generated and the principal in the grid still shows as "Authorized".
Expected
- When terminating from a lobbyist login in Miami, the employed date should instead be the
Status
date (Authorized date)
and prepopulate and should not be editable. User proceeds to terminate, and relationship status changes and documentation is created.
Actual
- Terminate modal shows employed date instead of
status date (displayed as authorized date)
(required) but it is empty and isn't editable. User can submit, but it doesn't go through and this may be the reason.
Changed Feature Flag to show authroization date ,changed JS code to bind authroization date

It looks good.
Then the Q2 was Auto-amended. Doesn't look like it picked up the changes made to Hoops.

Jeffery Hoops Primary $2,800.00

This looks correct, but didn't want to file it since the Q2 that was auto-amended isn't correct, without you looking at it.
This was caused by the issue with the Auto Amend logged in Bug 71341.
To fix this particular instance, I updated the data and regenerated the reports starting with the 2023 2nd Quarter report. The script used was:
Update Transactions
Set TransactionMode = 'A',
FiledDate = '2024-05-13 14:18:12.9970000',
FilingCalendarID = 1269
Where TransactionID = 539046
And TransactionVersionID = 2

The Democratic State Convention Delegate office in Madison County is showing up on the CEB-23 report for all counties I have generated it for. Here is an example from Carroll County:
Additionally, the candidates for this office are in No Election Held status, and they are not showing up on the Elected Delegates List report that the state uses for certification.
I removed the Form_Office records for office in question where forms were ceb and county not madison.

Zapata
cannot change the Ballot Status from RECEIVED to ACCEPTED of a voter
from the IT ticket we just had (Primary March Election).
The reasons TEAM is not letting them do the update are:
®
Zapata
gave us the wrong Application Received Date
on one of their VUID
#
1002920810
®
Zapata enter application incorrectly as 65 or older but the voter is disabled. Not 65 or older (date of birth is 5/5/1960).
Can we make the updates below for them?
-
Check only
Disable
in voter information
-
Update the Date Application Accepted/Rejected to
2/16/2024
When
testing we tried deleting the ballot from the absentee screen but we
can’t because if we want to add it back to the voter record, the
election dropdown menu no longer has the election. The main issue is
that when we try changing the app accepted date, we get the message of
voter is not 65 and older. The ballot eligibility reason was entered
incorrectly by the clerk as ‘65&older’. The voter was 63 years old
on March 5th but it still let her save it. The correct eligibility is
Disability. We tried updating the ballot by mail to ‘Disability’ but
it’s greyed out.
That’s the message she gets by trying to update the ABBM
.
That’s the Date Application Accepted/Rejected Zapata was supposed to gave us during the open ticket.

AC: Every Authorized principal (who was authorized at any point during a given report period) will have a page on the report, so 3 auth principals would be a single report for the reporting period but 3 pages - one for each principal (even if they didn't enter expenditures).
So, the code that generates the PDF should make a page for every principal that is either authorized or terminated regardless of if there is an expenditure for that principal or not. From our quick testing, the filing page is still allowing for input from terminated principals, but the
expenditure report is not displaying them.
Environment: QA
Filer ID: 97
Issue # 1:
Steps:
In Miami-Dade LRS, create a new lobbyist (approved by a principal to make sure have at least two principal) with unfiled reports.
Go to the report tab and select "File report"
Select "Add expenditure" and input some data and save. Do Not file report yet.
Go to Filer Dashboard and then Terminate a Principal under Principal Tab
Go to the report tab and select "File report"
Expected Results:
PDF should make a page for every principal that is either authorized or terminated (given they were considered authorized for any period of time during the given reporting period) regardless of if there is an expenditure for that principal or not.
Actual Results:
PDF only make a page for principal that is authorized NOT for terminated principal.
Issue # 2 :
While testing the above scenario please validate the below scenario with the PDF.

System generated filing obligations for non-election years for Candidates
whose profiles were updated for CY 2024 in error
See attached examples
When Candidates register online, they are not assigned an "agency", which is something we do internally.
I updated a candidate's profile to assign the "Candidates" agency, and when I was uploading their manual 2023 SFI, I noticed that they had a pending filing obligation for the non-election year dating back to the last time they ran for office. At that point, I checked other candidates whose profiles I had updated, and the same had occurred.
Elections are typically held every two years, and candidates do not need to file an SFI for the years they do not run for office.
Candidate Althea Garrison is a good example. If you look at the attached file, you will see she ran for office in 2016, 2020, 2022, and 2024. She did not run in 2023 as it was not an election year; therefore, the obligation is incorrect.
Five more with same issue:

This was a fix we did on the fly to address an issue on the EV page for the polling place report.
@Teja Garapati
can you add the details for the fix in here?
Issue is due to in poll_place_election table old poll place is used and had a data fix to update to correct poll place. PR is attached with data fix

Issue: A voter in Lewis County (
100810651) had a challenged ballot. The challenge was removed but the ballot still shows as not counted.
AC:
1. When challenge is removed, a ballot will show as counted.
2. The ballot for the 5/14 Primary for voter
100810651 will be shown as counted (in PROD).
This is a test set up in SIT. The ballot was initially challenged but then set to removed. It still shows not counted.
Added fix for Vote to be counted when challenge is removed.
The logic was written previously that Vote counted is toggled on whether it is a provisional or challenged ballot. So I have added two conditions for this issue to be resolved.
First, we check for FL_Challenged and Challenge status is "Challenge Removed" we say that vote is counted.
Second, we check for FL_Challenged and Challenge status is "Challenge Not Removed" we say that vote is not counted. The third and fourth conditions will remain same as previously.

This issue affects multiple filers and likely all filers who have been assigned to multiple election cycles and have one or more amended reports. The Filings tab on the public page for the filers is showing what appears to be a cartesian product of the reports joined to the cycles. So, if a filer has been assigned 4 election cycles and has a report that was amended 1 time, the public site shows 4 prior versions (plus the current). If that filer had amended a report 3 times, the public page would show 12 prior versions. Reproducible in Prod, UAT, & QA though may affect filers slightly differently in each due to data differences with regards to what reports have been filed and amended.
Note
- This will not show up for a filer that has only been assigned to a single election cycle.
Prod, UAT, or QA
Search for filer on public site. Use any of these:
Filer #1648, 1651, 1653, 1657, 1658, 1659, 1664, 1670, 1671, 1672, 1673, 1675, 1680, 1683, 1686
Go to Filings tab
Change Election Cycle dropdown to "ALL" (issue shows up without changing dropdown, but this makes it easier to observe)
Find a report that has been amended.
Note the name and cycle of the report.
Expand the carat to show the prior versions
Log into the application
Work on Behalf of the filer chosen in step 1
Go to Reports
Select the amended report from step 4
Expand the carat to show prior versions
Expected Results:
The number of prior versions of the reports shown on the public site should exactly match the number of prior versions show in the filers workspace
Actual Results:
The number of prior versions of the amended report is equal to the number of elections cycles times the number of prior versions of the report.
Figure 1 - Number of elections cycles - Note there are 4 election cycles
Figure 2: Filer workspace reports - Note there are two prior versions of the report
Figure 3: Public site filings tab - Note there are 8 prior versions (4 cycles * 2 versions)
The issue with amended reports displaying multiple times on the public site has been resolved. The public view now matches the private view, ensuring that only the relevant amended reports are displayed based on the specific year. Additionally, the anchor tag for report names has been reinstated to allow users to access all saved PDF versions of the filed reports.

As an SVRS user
I want to know that dates are accurate
AC:
The change/audit date will match the pended date and audit history when a voter is pended.
The change/audit date will match the change/audit date for status change when a voter is moved from Pending to Active.
Notes from the Monday Board:
Cabell noticed today that in some cases in this queue, voters processed in October are showing a date in November, even though that does not reflect on their audit history. I’ve attached the export of pending voters if that is needed, and an example is below:
Ashley Adkins, 100878966. She was an OVR that was received on 10/27 and processed on 10/30. Both of those dates correctly appear when viewing voter details, but the Change/Audit date shows 11/3.
When reviewing her audit history, it is correct in showing a 10/30 processing date… But it doesn’t make sense that an 11/3 date is populating on the Change/Audit section and on the Date Pended column of the Pending Voters Queue since there is no instance of an 11/3 audit history.
Other examples of this include 100814048, 000102208, and 100422319 to name a few.

Examples are Mary Malone5-12-1929, Karl Suslovic 7-24-1969, Bertha May Osmer 4-12-1938. I only noticed when I went to scan the registration card. However, Im noticing the same with onlines & Dmvs.

Mouse wheel up or down while mouse cursor is hovering over field. Note this will have an unintended consequence of adjust the value instead of moving the page up/down.
Expected Results
- Expenses entered should be aligned similarly to the column with expenditure categories. Mouse wheel up or down while hovering over field should not adjust value but instead move page up or down .

Issue reported by Garrick Frunz:
I’m reaching out with an odd question regarding a TRACER
email notification our team received on Sunday 5/19/2024 (attached). The
message indicates that Brian Urdiales (ID: 20245046943) terminated his
candidacy for the Colorado House of Representatives, District 63. However, his
candidate status still shows as “active,” and I don’t see a termination event
in his Event Log. I spoke with the candidate yesterday, and he verified that he
is still an active candidate with no plans to terminate his account.
Are you able to review the Brian Urdiales’s account to
determine why TRACER generated the attached termination message?
We also received a duplicate notification that Antonio
Soto had terminated his candidacy on 5/19/2024 (emails attached for reference
as well). The notifications were accurate, Antonio Soto’s account was
terminated, but I’m not sure why we received two notification emails. Since
there were two odd notification events on the same day, I wanted to investigate
Brian Urdiales’ notification and verify that the system is properly generating
the messages.

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to enter petition history in Lewis County
So that it does not request a driver's license number
AC: Investigate the cause and correct this error message for entering petition history as a county user
Notes:
Lewis County user 021CROWAN1 will be entering petition history later today, so she is walking through it to familiarize herself with the process. She goes to Voter Management > Election Participation History > Other Voter Participation History > Selects the “Weston First Due Fire Fee” petition (election) > Searches her first and last name. When she clicks search, she receives a message that the driver’s license number must equal 7. Screenshot is attached.
What would cause this? I cannot replicate it on my end in PROD. She will be receiving the petitions this afternoon and plans to enter them today, so I’m hoping this can be resolved quickly.

Go to file an expenditure report as the lobbyist
File the expendiure report, and then go and view filed reports
Attempt to amend the report. The option isn't displayed.
Expected Result - Filed reports vertical ellipsis should show an option to "amend" (like GA base product)
Actual Result - Amend reports is missing from the filed reports dropdown.

In Miami Dade it seems we can't view any registration reports and at the time this bug is created no filed exp reports either.
Register a lobbyist in Miami with the related principal and approve the relationship.
Work on behalf or sign in as the lobbyist
Try to view any reports expenditure/registration, etc. All showing blank tab.
Expected Results: User can view registration and expenditure reports

I found this issue while I was trying to file a late report. After adding a few expenditures to a report and attempting to file it, the filing screen did not close. Clicking the arrow at the top left of the filing screen resulted in creating an amended report saved for later under the filed tab.
Environment: QA
Filer ID:
Steps:
Register a lobbyist with a principal
Principal authorizes the lobbyist
WOB of the lobbyist and set the report late for two months early
File the report and add expenditures
Expected Results:
Clicking on 'File Report' and signing it should redirect you back to the report page.
Actual Results:
Clicking the "File" report and "agree" triggered the error code 450 and does the following.
The screen would spin for a while and then remain on the same display.
Clicking the 'File report' button will create a new version of that report.
Clicking the top-left arrow will create an amended version of that report to save for later.
N.B.:
I observed the same behavior in Georgia a few months back.

Tim,
The
PIR reports are not including confidential voters when the reports are
pulled. We were just made aware of this by a PIR requestor.
These voters should also populate in the report with the residential/mailing addresses marked as *****.
We do not know exactly when or why this changed in the PIR module.
Examples below:
PIR# is not including confidential voters (This is incorrect)
The below voters ARE NOT appearing in this PIR report.
Voter list report is pulling correctly:
Added my comments for the ticket Added code fix to show public restricted records. PR is attached

Can someone look into AK Test for a user with the last name of
Finkbiner? Steven Niven tried to add them as a user in Test and the system said that the user exists, but he cannot see them on a search. Apparently this happened a LONG time ago and was somehow attributed to a Prod restore to Test and someone on our end had to remove an entry from a table in Test.
Along with needing to see Finkbiner, need to see Grace
McAllister, as well. can’t add her TEST.

RE: 73172 - AK - Phantom users in Test
Yes, here’s the query I used, they can make changes and use
for other users if needed:
UPDATE USERS
SET FL_DISABLED = 'N', FL_DELETE = NULL
WHERE ID_USER IN ('GMCALLIS','HAJFINK5')

Issue: Creating new accounts in TEST causes duplicate accounts, editing one causes edits to both accounts
Notes from AK:
I created 2 new accounts in TEST and they both created double entries:
I am going to Inactivate one of the accounts for each of them, but this should certainly not be happening!
I tried to add the YubiKey to one account and it adds it to both.
Cannot INACTIVATE one – they both INACTIVATE.
I looked in the DB and found only one record, so this is an interface issue

Business is listed as BOTH, when it should be just employ lobbyist. MORE PRESSING-one of the contribution checks was not cashed. The return contribution module is not finding the original expenditure. Below is the original but it is not showing up on this list.

Contribution should be on this page
As far as BOTH goes:
System will not allow them to change the registration on View Edit screen. Attached is a letter from FE Corp requesting the change from Both to Employs a Lobbyist.
Please make that chang eon teh back end.
Transaction is not missing. It was not entered as a return contribution. It is present in the "Amend Transactions" section, where it is correctly displayed. If they want it to be a return transaction that's something they'll have to do.
I modified their registration and updated it to be "Employs A Lobbyist".

Email from Martha: Glitch:: 24-hour reporting Pop Up.
Reported to Martha that When logging into a Committee Account, they are receiving the following message.
This is from Lisa Marglies - Planed Parenthood of Northern New England
Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund & PAC.
The message appears to only be showing for PACs, not candidates. The 24 hour
reporting period starts next week. The page we use to manage this is correct
(see below). Can you see what is going on and correct it so people don’t freak
out?
This was due to user error in the Threshold set up table.
Once Martha corrected the mistake in the dates in the table, it's now working.

Email Notifications - VH - Colorado
This is a previously resolved issue from earlier in the week.
Colorado county reported that they did not get one of their interface
emails on 5/28.
Colorado
uploaded two VH files between 5/28-5/30. Only one voting history
interface email came through noreply for the DEM upload on 5/29. Also
ran both Voting History for both Runoffs and confirmed Republican and
Democratic history was uploaded and pulling on the report.
The county is now receiving emails.

Email from Martha -
Last week
“The House Republican Fund” needed to file an independent expenditure report.
The report involved two expenditures for Staples (literature printing) and the
Maine Republican Party (postage). The two expenditures impacted 3 candidates
each. However, the system only accepted on expenditure transaction. This seemed
peculiar to me, so I was able to recreate it in UAT. See the same PAC name, and
the two expenditures I entered, and only one of which showed up on the report.
What do you
think is going on?
Please let
me know, I need to get this report filed.
Response after research -
Martha –
I’m confused,
are you saying the committee needed to enter their transactions as IE’s and the
system wouldn’t let them?
Did they
receive any sort of error message? What exactly is keeping them from
entering the expenditures as IE’s?
In UAT the
transactions are entered as IE’s and I see that only the one expenditure to
Staples dated 5/24/2024 I the amount of $843.61 is triggering an IE
Report.
I did some
research, and I found the system is working as designed.
Since all
none of the candidate allocations on the $412.75 IE to the Maine Republican
Party, are greater than $250.00. an IE Report is not getting
triggered.
In order for
the IE to trigger an IE Report, at least one of the allocations needs to be
over the amount set up in the IE Threshold table.
I found this
information in the IE Documentation (FE 2 – Reports – Independent Expenditure
Report) for the system that was created on 7/19/2017 and there have not been
any changes to this functionality since that time.
I think you
will need to have the committee delete the Expenditures as entered, and
re-enter them as IE’s. If they are having a problem with this, we will
need to know what the exact issue is. Are they not getting the IE option
when the add a new transaction? Are they able to enter the transaction,
but not save it. Are they getting an error on the screen, when trying to
enter the transaction? If yes, where is the error occurring.
Etc.
Hope this
helps.
PS – I’ve
attached the design document for the IE Report, that contains the current BR
the system is using.

Email from Martha - She used the Admin Reports -
Organization Contact Information
and notified several committees of the upcoming IE Report Filing deadlines. Mr Barbalace received one of her notices. He called to tell her he is no longer associated with the Committee (Political Party Committee) Saco Democratic City Committee ID 2155. He was on the Admin Report - Organization Contact Information
In PROD as of 6/3/2024 - User Administration, his Account Status was showing as Inactive, but his Officer Status is still showing as Active. I updated his Account Status and checked the LOCKED checkbox on his Account Status as well, so he is now Inactive and LOCKED, however his Officer Status is still showing as Active. I don't have a way to change that. Normal system behavior would be when a Registration is updated, and a Officer is removed then updated with a new officer, the User Account Status would still show as Active, but the Officer Status would be showing as Inactive.
Not sure how they got the officer Status to show Active, but the officer is not an active officer of the committee anymore.
Looking at this again on Monday June 3, 2024. User Account Status is showing as just LOCKED, but Officer Status is still showing as Active. They must have changed something again!
Both User Account Status and Officers Status need to be updated to Inactive.
Admin Report - Contact List - Committee
Admin Report - Organization Contact Information
Report is using Election Cycle for Election Year criteria.
This Report is showing Mr Barbalance,'s Officer Status as
Inactive.
So we have a mismatch somewhere or the Admin Report is pulling User Account Status instead
The Officer Status for Kenneth Barbalace in User Administration is showing as Active, His User Account Status is just showing as Locked. The Locked is correct, the User Admin page itself shows he has never logged in, but I think the Grid should show Inactive and Locked both.
Both the Inactive and Locked flags on the User Admin Page are showing as checked.
In UAT - Using the same committee 2155 - I filed a Committee Registration Amendment on 5/31/2024.
I removed the old Treasurer Bruce Martel and added a new one Lisa McCreary.
It looked like it worked correctly.
In UAT - working
as an Admin Register a Party Committee. (Committee Type of Political Party Committee is not available from the Public Site).
RedNeck Party 493803
Treasurer - Lisa McCreary
:
Did not ever log in or authenticate the user Lisa McCreary
Then Amended the Registration,
As PO - Amending the Registration - Removing Lisa McCreary as Treasurer adding Karen Waddell.
Karen is now showing on the Admin Page - Officers Grid
Log out and back in as Admin User - Then look at the User Administration page.
System looks like it correctly Inactivated the Officer Status of Lisa McCreary, with a User Account Status is still showing as Unauthenticated.
Checking the Admin Report - Org List to see what it shows there. Org list is not showing Lisa McCreary, but is showing Inactive Treasurer Karen Waddell.
When a Treasurer is updated in the system, their
User Account Status
remains Active, but their Officer Status is updated to Inactive.
Not sure how Maine got Barbalance Officer Status to show as ACTIVE, should be showing as Inactive, since he's no longer a officer for that committee.

Investment totals were not saving to the db correctly. Calculation logic for the pdf and and what got saved to the db where different. Which is why report #1 looked correct on the pdf, but had something totally different saved to the db effecting all downstream reports.

This issue appears to affect all filings displayed on the Lobbyist Explore Reports page. There are multiple listings of each report and amendment for each filed report per filer.

San Jacinto is experiencing an issue with their voting history report. Two voters (VUID

and VUID

) are missing precinct information. We tried to re-append the voters to their streets, but nothing changed.
The
report they are running includes precincts 3, 5, 9, and 11. However,
due to the missing precinct information for these two voters, they are
not appearing in the report.
County has a PIR request and needs this fixed. The requestor has specifically requested the report in PDF format.
For reference, VUID 2202184974 belongs to Precinct 11, and VUID 11012258733 belongs to Precinct 9.

Hi Sean,
We need to stop the Docum
ent Generation process.
Delete all docs from this round and restart.
There are two major bugs.
One is the date is being placed in the Agency Name (this
should be the category from the voter registration (typically
PFDA/PFDM). That said, since auto gen occurs anytime there is a
missing record, it should just be the batch type category.
Second, that date on the application should not be the
generation date. It should be the received date on the record.
Could we get both of these issues fixes as soon as
possible? These should be higher priority than all other bugs.
Once the bugs are fixed we should delete all documents
generated from this pfd cycle and start the generation again. We
can discuss that more once you confirm the bugs are fix.
Thanks for your help with this urgent issue.

From GA on 5/28 10:44 AM: Adding clients for Jay Morgan 585620, Lauren Pallow 571225, and Charlotte Davis 567409 fails with a red x. The clients are American Transaction Processors Association (658941), Public Trust Advisors (658942), Volkswagen (658943), Hyland (658944), GoGuardian (658945), and VISA (658946). These were added Tyler Jefferson Kaplan 581963 successfully in prod.
When researching this we found that the officer for the clients is a system admin. Testing the flow of an admin also being an officer for clients didn't show any problems. There's no way to test this in Training because the accounts were created in Prod after the last restore to Training so there is no way to test on the actual accounts in a live environment. A dev will need to recreate this locally using a Prod backup.

Fayette Co. Democratic Executive Committee ID 1914 - Had several reports that have been unfiled and checked in waiting on bug # 59496 to be fixed. (Checked-In Reports Preview/File not picking up the Treasurer at the time of check-in, instead it was picking up the current treasurer) That has now been corrected, but before filing the reports that have been checked in, Lisa Blake called and noticed this committee is missing several reports on their filing schedule. Trying to add them in and they aren't being saved.
When you click Add Report from the Unfiled Reports, page - enter all the information for a missing report, then click CREATE, on the Add Report page. You get the spinning circle, but Nothing happens.
The Add Report page is still displayed, and the CREATE button is still active, but no report has been added.
When you close the Add Report page, the report hasn't been added to the Unfiled Reports page. No Error.
Wondering if it's due to trying to insert reports between reports that already exist and have been checked in?

I want to know why there are inconsistencies with voter search
So that they can be fixed if necessary
AC: Investigate the reason for the differences between Advanced Voter Search and Voter Information Search in Hampshire county, and resolve if necessary
NOTE: This difference is happening when user searches statewide
Notes from WV:
I was completing my leg work on a voter before registering/updating the voter and my search didn't bring the voter up in any county. I was using the Advanced Voter Search on the dashboard. I tried different ways of searching for the voter as I do when it is female.
So when I selected the voter on the DMV list she showed as being registered Inactive in Berkeley County. 100753413 Christina Lorraine Digrazio. Then I went to the Voter Management, Voter Search Information. This pulls the voter up in Berkeley County.
At first I thought she was a purged voter from Berkeley County. But the status is Inactive.

As an SVRS user
I want to know why Address table is being populated by blank records
AC: Investigate the code and remove blank records if not in use
NOTE: Appears to be related to Voter Add filings.
Added Fix for the below issue
1. When we set the UOCAVA status through voter info->change for existing voter. it was inserting null values for timestamp and iduser
2. New Voter/DDS/OVR with UOCAVA status but no mailing address inserting the null record in the Address table
3. New Voter/DDS/OVR with UOCAVA status and mailing address inserting the null record in the Address table
4. Add a new Voter with Uocava status and mark it as a ballot through Election management->ballot and it was inserting null values in the timestamp and iduser field of the address table.
5. Add new Voter inserting null values in the address table

Hays county has made sure there are no districts assigned to the precincts.
We
ran a voter list and only shows some canceled voters to the precincts

We also ran a street list and there is no data. Checked in district assignment and the precincts are not there.

Email from Brett - Cathy retrieved a voicemail message from the above committee. They had a $1463.67 contribution entered from Colorado Republican Committee that did not generate a Major Contributor report. Checked the set up in Tracer and everything is associated properly and dates have been entered for the MC period, so from what I’m seeing, it should’ve generated the report. Not sure why it didn’t.
Considering having the committee delete the transaction, since it hasn’t been filed, re-enter and seeing if it generates at that point, but want to check with you to see if you notice anything we can’t see.
I told him to have them delete and reenter the transaction. No changes have been made to that system in a long time, and there haven't been any changes to the BR's around MC Reports. ???
Return Email - from Cathy Hill
I called him back and asked him to delete the contribution and enter a new one for $1500. He did this and didn’t get the message and no mc report was generated.

I cleared space on the web server, and IT worked to mitigate the Cloudflare errors. The client is now able to access the system and upload documents.

Additional information
The user clicks
the Import button, the system checks the validity of the file format.
If invalid, an
error message is displayed to the user and the process stops.
If valid, the
file is placed in the import queue and a record is added to the import history
table with the file name, file description, import date, a status of “Queued”,
and a queue position.
When the import
processor is free, it selects the next file to be processed, changes the status
of the record in the import history table to “Processing” and decrements the
queue position for all remaining unprocessed files.
The import
processor processes each record in the import file in turn.
The record count is incremented.
The system validates the transaction
against all business rules configured for the type of transaction being
processed.
Any
errors that would prevent the transaction from being added to the database
(missing required fields, fields with the wrong data type, etc.) are written to
the results table as an error with the external Reference ID. All errors for
that record are written as separate records in the results table.
Any
violations of campaign finance rules are written to the results table as a warning
with the external transaction ID. All warnings for that record are written as
separate records in the results table.
Once all records
in the import file have been processed, the import history record is updated
with a status of Pending. The record count, number of records with errors and
number of records imported are added to the history record.
A Review Import
task is added to the Immediate To Do list for the committee who performed the
import.
A snack bar is
displayed to the user if they are logged in informing them that the import has
been processed and it is ready for review.
The snack bar includes a Review button
to display the Import Results screen for the import.
Once a file has
been successfully imported, the user must review and either accept or reject
the import from the action menu on the Import Manager screen.

They just want the fixed asset from the closed committee
moved to the open committee in the 2023 Annual Report. For some reason, when
you go to amend transactions it will not allow you to do it all the way. It
looks like it will, but then it doesn’t. Would be handy if it wouldn’t stop short.
However, we can add it into the current filing period, but that is technically
incorrect.
The problem we have ran into now is that we can’t file an amendment for the 2023 annual in which we can transfer the old laptop to the new committee. It seems like the capability is there, but for some reason when the fixed asset is added in amend transactions it becomes an in-kind contribution (this is correct) and then unchecks the fixed asset check box (this is incorrect because now it is no longer on the books as a fixed asset). However, if we file the transfer of the laptop in the 2024 filing period (outside amend transactions) the function works correctly, and it would become a fixed asset. The committee wants it done correctly and the 2023 report amended to show when they actually transferred the laptop upon closing the old committee and beginning the new committee (which I agree with).
It looks like to me that the closed committee The COX Campaign, already is showing an In-Kind Expenditure on the 2024 Annual that was filed on
5/9/2024
. It's showing dated 5/9/2024 an expenditure for $699.00 it was for an HP Pagewide Pro Printer. That expenditure shows on Schedule C-2 InKind Expenditures and Schedule G - Elimination of Assets for the old committee. So that all looks good. It has been filed on the 2024 Year End Report.
The New Cox Campaign ID 01005808 - Shows a 2023 Annual FILED, and a 2024 Annual that is due on 1/21/2025.
Not logged in as the Committee - View Contributions / Loans.
Search by Filing Year 2023 - and $ Amount 698 - 700 Receiving Committee The Cox Campaign - No records to Display. (It's not been FILED).
However when Logged in as the Committee - Select Amed Transactions. Click the 2023 Annual, Transaction Type Contribution, Transaction Category, In-Kind, I see two In-Kind Contributions one dated 5/26/23 and the other one dated 10/2/2023.
The one dated 10/1/2023 is showing up on the 2023 Annual.
I don't see this In-Kind Contribution on the 2023 Filed Annual. I see a total In-Kind Amount of 92.89.
I
Checked Pending
Working as the committee - Edit/File Pending Transactions. Filing Period 2024 Annual. - I get " No records to view". I can't select the 2023 Filing Period, only the 2024.
Amend Transactions - 2023 Annual -
I see an In-Kind Contribution from The COX Campaign dated 5/26/2023. It's showing as In-Kind on the 2023 Annual Report.
When I click on the Edit/File Pending Transactions, I'm not able to search by the 2023 Annual Report only 2024, so I assume that it's not pending?
It looks like the transaction didn't make it on to the 2023 Annual Report?
Maybe Amend the Transaction, don't actually change anything just Amend and Save and maybe that will move it to the Amendment Transactions, and we can file it on the 2023 Report??? It's not in the report beginning balance or the itemized transactions. Can't find it.
I do see a problem with the Dates. The Date for the transaction out of The COX Campaign is in 2024, and the date into The new Cox Campaign is dated 2023.
Not a good practice.
Moved transactions to new filing calendar and account.

As a SVRS user
I need the ability to run epollbooks by Municipal Precinct and to include Ward in epollbook
So that the epollbook has all the required data
AC: Epollbooks can be ran by Municipal Precinct and the counties can choose to include the Ward in the epollbook
please provide an Epollbook export in Berkeley for the precincts
below with a column for Ward included in voter data. It should be wards
1-5. This election is for the City of Martinsburg. They need a sample as
soon as possible and a final epollbook after May 14, their voter registration

As a SVRS user
I want to know what the changes are that were made to voter
000213492 on 12/27/23 and why the voter participation history is showing comments from the 2018 primary and the 2022 general
So that I can determine if something is not showing accurately on the voter
AC: Provide what all the changes were that were made on 12/27/23 (this shows multiple "Other" changes made only a few minutes apart)
AC: Where did the comments come from that were listed for the 2018 Primary to the 2022 General
I was hoping to get some clarification on Hampshire voter 000213492. Her audit history shows 8 entries of “OTHER” changes made on 12/27/2023. Tammy says she did not make changes, and they are all date stamped just minutes apart…
Additionally, under Voter Participation History, there are comments spanning from the 2018 Primary to the 2022 General, and Tammy said she did not enter those. The voter re-registered on 12/26/2023, so I am unsure what is happening with the comments

Degonia, Tom addresses for contributions not showing in reports. When I try to add this to violations, it does not show up. Many more not shown. Committee uploaded by batch I assume.
The business rules on uploading a report says that an address needs to be added. The system will either add it because the contributor is already in the system (Filer will add the CCFID number) on report or if not then the committee needs to add the address themselves on the report.

I have sent info to RI to see if they care if I try it from here, with the information they would enter, and also if they are getting the same error when the Receive Items that are not amendments?
The problem was a unique key constraint violation when updating Bank Account Submission records during the process of receiving registration amendments. The error occurred due to unexpected data patterns in the existing Bank Account data. The unexpected data patterns exist for multiple committees and is not easily fixable without the potential for breaking the Bank Account Search and Submission functionality, so instead, I changed how these records are updated in the registration amendment process to avoid the constraint violation.

Public Site Expenditure Search - Showing the same expenditure twice. Once when it's been filed on a 48 Hr IE Report, and then again when it's filed on the regular report.
The Expenditure Search Results grid does not have a filed date or a Report Name on the grid, so the expenditure looks like the same expenditure is showing twice and it's counting in the totals twice. Summary by Month.
The search results and summary amounts have been adjusted to not include duplicate expenditures that are filed on both a 48 Hour report and a regular report. Instead, the expenditure filed first (that meets the search criteria) will be the one included.

From GA on 5/28 10:44 AM: Adding clients for Jay Morgan 585620, Lauren Pallow 571225, and Charlotte Davis 567409 fails with a red x. The clients are American Transaction Processors Association (658941), Public Trust Advisors (658942), Volkswagen (658943), Hyland (658944), GoGuardian (658945), and VISA (658946). These were added Tyler Jefferson Kaplan 581963 successfully in prod.
When researching this we found that the officer for the clients is a system admin. Testing the flow of an admin also being an officer for clients didn't show any problems. There's no way to test this in Training because the accounts were created in Prod after the last restore to Training so there is no way to test on the actual accounts in a live environment. A dev will need to recreate this locally using a Prod backup.

Hi,
A new(ish) bug with
absentee applications. When processing paper absentee applications it is not
saving the overseas or military flag for the Primary election. It is doing it
for the General though.
Some screenshots
below. After doing the voter registration side we go to the absentee
application processing side and enter in the specifics and save.
After saving it
shows that is has scheduled ballots for both elections
When you select the
edit pencil for the primary election, there is no box selected for the UOCAVA
status.
When you select the
edit pencil for the genera election, the UOCAVA status is correctly selected.
I am unsure if this
is impacting OABA batches too…..

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to see the previous precincts for each voter when applicable on the Voter Cancellations document
So that no information is missing

1. VM > Search Voter Info > Cancellations > Select any option from drop down (example here: deceased) > Print all. The system takes you to the reports page, but when the user clicks "View Criteria," none is found
2. VM > Search Voter Info > Cancellations > Select any option from drop down (example here: NCOA) > Commas are shown for some voters where the address should be.
3. VM > Search Voter Info > Cancellations > Select any option from drop down (example here: moved out of state) > Print all > There are commas in between the street number & name, and between the street type and city. There is no space between the city & zip code.

Pubic Site Admin Report - Report of Contributions and Expenditures.
When generating reports for Candidates, Candidate Committees, or Committees from this Report Option, The format of the report is incorrect. It is not pulling in the Cover Page, and adding a blank page instead with an error of No Data found, correctly, and all the pages have the PREVIEW watermark on them. There are also additional blank pages being created.
This same report exists on the secure site - Reports>Admin Reports> Report on Contributions and Expenditures.
I've attached a sample report that was pulled.
When searching you can search for the Candidate, which appears to be trying to provide the Candidate Expenditure Report, I would think that report should not be an option. Since the Report Label is Report of Contributions and Expenditures, Standalone Candidate's only file Expenditure reports.
.June 3, 2014 Statement of Personal Expenditures by Candidate is attached from the Filed Reports section of the Candidate Workspace.
June 3, 2024 Statement of Personal Expenditures by Candidate from the Admin Report is also attached. It has a PREIVEW watermark on each page, and the 1st page (Summary Page ) of the report is missing.
After receiving the go-ahead from Garrick Frunz, I have hidden this report on the public site. The script used is:
Update ReportType
Set ShowOnPublic = 0,
UpdateUserId = 1,
UpdateTimeStamp = GetDate()
Where FormNumber = 'RPT-CF-FILE-004'

Calculations on Summary totals are not adding up on display when previewing the totals
Correct math should be:
Beginning Cash Balance + Contributions Received - Expenditures Made = Ending Cash Balance
Cash Balance on first report should be what the filer has brought in from legacy if there is any on line 2. I do not see any reports with balances on the legacy account. Haley is calling PAC to see if they have a balance to carry over
From Emily's research:
1. First filed report shows BCB cash of 254889.70 on the report but there is no transfer balance transaction showing in contributions for this. This is causing the running total balance to be incorrect. Should be 0 if there is no transaction
2. Under 2022 going from the 6/30/2023 report to the 12/31/2023 report the in-kind contribution balance is not showing on the report but reappears on the 1/31/2024 report correctly.
3. The 1/31/2024 report had 87624.25 in new contributions. This amount seems to be falling off the next report preview. If you add 87624.25 to the ending cash balance on that draft report the cash balance becomes 449358.50 which will then match the running total (once corrected to include the original bcb cash amount not showing)
**Haley is calling filer to find out if they did in fact have a transfer amount.
Should be Beginning Balance + Contributions - Expenditures - Reimbursements = Ending balance
Screenshot of what the calculations are now. Relates to #1 above
#2 above
Screenshot (This filer did not have a beginning cash balance from legacy)
added checks for LC committees to be consistent with calculations for other ROs

Filers have been able to file a Statement of No Activity when they actually had activity during the reporting period. This affects 26 reports for 23 filers in the Production DB. Many of these are in UAT & QA as well. This issue seems to be a timing issue when launching the File Report page. I was able to get the No Activity checkbox checked once in QA but could not reproduce it. The checkbox was briefly enabled, I checked it, then got a spinning wheel and when that cleared the checkbox was checked but not enabled

Issue: Similar to the barcode batch issue, the docs are being attached to the incorrect voter in the VR batch
Notes from AK:
Document no. 1 processed just fine. Document no. 2 also processed fine, but on Document no. 3 it shows that the document had already been processed and assigned to the voter from the first document. I did not process anything for document no. 3. Upon viewing the voter record from document one, the voter has both the first document and the third document assigned to his record. The person on the second document contained only the second document, correctly. I have stopped processing the batch, and will wait for further instruction.

Fixed SQL for linking batch images to voters. Also fixed document display in VR batch when on the voter list page after searching for a voter.

Issue: Whenever a voter selects online and only provides their email address, the auto generated ballot line is always entirely blank, including the UOCAVA flag and the provided email address.
Code change to fix email not being assigned when ballots are generated and voter doesn't have a mailing address.

AC:
User selected status and status reason will overide "Pending" status in scenario described below
Issue: During a new voter registration, when one of the "without verification" Site ID option is selected, "pending" status is automatically applied which is correct. However, if the user then enters their own status and status reason like "Reject", this is ignored and Pending is still applied.
Select one of the without verification options
Defaults to pending (expected), but I changed to rejected status and status reason, then clicked review
System ignored my entry and applied pending status
Removed the condition which was making the other status to pending if id verification options are in above mentioned one

Issue: When batch scanning Voter Registration, cropping the signature and then uploading is causing two error messages
This appears to just be in Prod and is not reproducible in the QA environment
We are experiencing batch scanning errors. This is also occurring in region 5.
The first error is when we to VR batch, scan the documents, crop the signatures and then press upload this error message appear.
The next one is a new error that occurs by doing the same process as above. VR batch, scan documents, crop signatures and upload and then we get the below error also.
Added a bindingRedirect setting that was missing from the Web.config in Prod which was causing exceptions when saving batch scans.

Utah statute does not require punctuation. The system needs to be able to allow an entity type that does not include punctuation.
Example, "Civix Corp" should be allowed, even though the system enforces "Civix Corp
.
"
For Business Corps and Nonprofit Corps, "Corp", "Co", and "Inc" don't work, and the system is requiring "Corp.", "Co.", or "Inc."

Email From Becky:
We have this email address in a lot of places in the system. It wouldn’t take too long to do the updates, because we could do a simple search and replace. However, we would probably need to do a full build, and testing would take some time. Spot testing should be sufficient, since it really is a search and replace of text.
We have several items that are ready to go into the next build. There would have been a build already if we had not lost access to our DEV database.
We could go ahead and update the email address on the G&H email, and then create a separate ticket to update all the other places.

Specific fields in the import file need to have values that are listed in lookup tables. Those fields and values are specified in the file descriptions for the imports (attached) with certain lookups which may be modified over time having separate downloads from the Import Manager page (also attached). If a field dependent on a lookup contains invalid data, the system should reject that record and provide an appropriate message to the filer.
For the Occupation Type, the instructions are ambiguous as to whether the code or description from the lookup should be used in the import file. If a filer uses the description rather than the code, the system is failing to import the contributions and failing to raise an error on the records with invalid data. Consideration should be given to accepting the record if the description is used and substituting the code for the description in the transaction saved to the DB. This should only be considered if it will not impact the performance and if it will not overly tax development resources.

Create an import file containing records that have the description of the occupation in the cbOccupation column of the Contributions tab

Expected Results
System should skip the records with invalid Occupation codes
System should raise an error for each record with an invalid Occupation code that references the record and field so that the filer knows what to correct.
Actual Results
System reports that records were created for those records in the file with invalid Occupation codes, but after accepting the import, those records cannot be found.
Additional testing steps
This bug was raised in regards to a specific lookup-based field. However, there is the possibility that the same issue may be present for all fields based on lookups. To ensure that additional bug are not raised regarding other fields later, additional testing should be done by Dev and/or QA.
For every field in each tab that is tied to a lookup table, create a record that has an invalid value in that field (one bad field per record).
Import the file.
Expected Results
The system should report an appropriate error for each record with a bad lookup informing the user of what needs field and record to be fixed

For converted data, the initial EventLog records are those of the Conversion Event...

Need to know what should be done to get the EventLog.CreatedDate set to a value that is appropriate in relation to the dates used by the application. Would be best to learn what flags/variables in the system are being used and how so that future conversion timezone differences are not hard coded... thanks!

I would like to change a voter using the pre-fill option
So that the party is correctly prefilled
AC: A voter's party must be prefilled when the user selects "Pre-Fill fields" when changing a voter using OVR Voter registration
Notes from WV:
Please see the email below from Marion County, as this voter’s party is not pre-filling when they select “Pre-Fill Fields.” Could this be caused by the discrepancy of how the party appears on the UI?
This morning while changing the registration of James Herman Reese, Jr. #000448719 who appeared on the OVR list, I noticed that CIVIX was not populating the change party. Mr. Reese was a democrat changing to independent. When I clicked the Prefill Fields Button, his party does not change. I asked Jennifer McCue to also try, with the same results. Is this a civix issue that is happening throughout the state? Thank you for checking into this important matter.

On Public site Election Cycle dropdown should be labelled "Filing Cycle" as Lobbying cycles are not tied to elections
Public site only has the current year and "All Years" in the Filing Cycle dropdown (currently labeled "Election Cycle"). Should list all cycles for which the Lobbyist is/was registered.
Contents of the Summary, Employers, and Filings tabs should reflect the selected Filing Cycle (currently labeled "Election Cycle").
Lobbyist details page may be accessed from the Search results, from the Explore Lobbyists screen, or from a hyperlink on an Employers page. The default selected Filing Cycle will differ based on what the entry point is. From the Employer screen or Search results, the source may have a different filing cycle chose and that becomes the default even if the year is not displayed in the dropdown for the Lobbyist. This is a bug only because the Filing Cycle for the data displayed is not actually shown in the dropdown as it should be.
No Filing Cycle is chosen when entering the public Lobbyist Details page from the Search Results if not choosing the current year.
The Summary tab will show contributions and expenditures for a selected filing cycle, but when "All Years" is chosen, reverts to "No activity". If there are any contributions or expenditures filed on any reports, then the "All Years" display should sum all Contributions and Expenditures from all filings for all years for the Lobbyist. "No activity" should only be shown if there are no file Contributions or Expenditures for the selected filing cycle or cycles.

TX TEAMS normally sends out emails in the morning with a summary of the interfaces it runs, and this has only been working sporadically. Talked with Teja about it, and he said there is an issue on the AWS side. Here is the error:

From that date on, we are progressively rejecting such requests. To resolve the issue, you must migrate to Signature Version 4.

When I tried in UAT, I can't get the report added, on the Add Report page, when I click Create - I get the Error indicator, but there isn't any actual error message. The report is not added.
The problem was that the report was already on the filing schedule, but it was not showing up in the unfiled reports list (or the Immediate To Do list). I have fixed the queries that pull those lists, and now the report is showing up both places.

Environment:
All 2.0 CFIS/FDS registration pages (broken functionality in demo UAT and ABQ QA)
Filer ID:
Steps:
Go to any CFIS/FDS registration page in ABQ QA or demo UAT.
Try to select a state for registration.
Expected Results:
The state dropdown should be visible because there should not be any hardcoded client checks because all configuration should be handled by system configuration variables.
Actual Results:
The state dropdown is not visible. There are hardcoded client checks that hide fields for any client that's not GA, NM, or AU (in the screenshot below). This results in things like the state dropdown from disappearing.

Screenshot of missing state dropdown on CFIS and FDS registration pages:
Screenshot of some of the hardcoded code:
Added missing feature flags to all clients and removed front end logic that was preventing State and County field from working for all non GA or NM clients.

Wells Fargo Cybersource has detected fraudulent eCheck transactions being submitted via their SOAP API. Since no eCheck payments have been received in 2024 thorough our application, this has not directly affected our interface. But, in response to the threat, NM SOS are shutting down the SOAP API on the back end system. To ensure that the end user's experience is not negatively affected by this back-end change, we need to shut down the ability for an end user to initiate an eCheck payment.
Subsequent tickets will be entered to add messaging to the system to inform users of the temporary unavailability of eCheck payments and what other payment options are available, and to work with Cybersource on a more secure method of submitting eCheck payments.
disabled calls to e-check payment and disabled submit in the e-check form

Cathy Welch is the filer. She asked us to merge CWELCH14212 to her main login CWELCH7923. I did the reverse so now all her accounts a under CWELCH14212. She has asked for us to unmerge it.
It is easier to switch the direction of the merge than to "unmerge" the accounts (which might have required looking at a DB backup). So I have fixed the data so that it is as if they merged in the correct direction.
The script used is:
Update Officer
Set AssociatedUserID = 6843,
UpdateUserID = 1,
UpdateTimeStamp = dbo.GetCurrentDateTime(GetUTCDate())
Where AssociatedUserID = 14212

From Kristi:
We are looking at the calendar year for 2021 and calendar year for 2022. If you compare the Deceased Task report to the Cancellation Trend Report for the same time range, numbers (at least last night) were grossly different. The cancellation report was pulling zeros for most counties. I know there will be differences in the two reports but they should be close.
I will also add that I ran a report this morning and it generated quickly and appears more accurate but have not compared the decease task report yet.

committee has not received 1/17/24 Annual Show cause 1 notice and the committee was referred directly to OSP. Please do the research and let us know why.
The committee received a refund and the manner in which the system deducted the waived amount (now fixed) resulted in the violation not matching up correctly on the backend. They adjusted the violation to $40 in February, but the referral in June shows a violation amount of $60. This should be fixed on prod going forward now.

Since the outage on Friday, we haven't had the TX interfaces run on their own. We had to manually kick them off today. I checked with DevOps, and everything is mounted correctly. We need to look into why these aren't running like normal.

In 2022 they created a second instance of the libertarian party somehow with the following purpose:
"Reserving this name in the event that a genuinely organized LPD decides to assert control over the ballot line"
I removed this registration and moved some information over to their current registration and they now should be able to save their own updates. There did not appear to be anything associated with it other than some updates that were intended to be added to the original committee.
So as of now, they can do anything they would like to get their registration in order, and I'm going to just have them enter the information they've been trying to enter on PROD. I also updated the emails for everyone so they can use
secretary@lp-delaware.org
and
treasurer@lp-delaware.org
now.

This was found when deleting duplicate reports for this committee, Bug # 75133.
I went ahead and deleted the duplicate reports that were causing the reports to show up on the Immediate to Do List.
Then on the
Unfiled Reports
page there is still one report that I didn't think should be there. It is the Post-General Report. That Reports has a beg/end date of 03/30/2015 - 10/24/2020.
There are several reports on the FILED Reports page that cover those dates. In fact all of the 2020 FILED Reports.
2020 1st Quarter Report, 2020 Primary, 2020 2nd Qtr, 2020 3rd Qtr, 2020 General, and the 2020 4th Qtr Report.
All of those reports have been filed, but do not show the transactions that are showing up when you preview the Post-General Report and I don't see any 2020 Transactions that are UNFILED.
I don't have any way to make sure all the 2020 Transactions that are showing up on that Post General Report PREVIEW have been filed on the other reports for 2020. I don't see any transactions for 2020 that have not been filed, but can you check to make sure before I remove that report as well. I don't want to loose transactions!
PS - I tired to get an Ad Hoc Report using the Transactions View, but it's keeps returning with 0 results when I ask for all the Contributions. That's never worked correctly, and w/o a field for Committee ID, it's not very reliable either.
Deleted the Post General Report.

URGENT to figure out why the Felon Match screen portion has INCORRECT
ssns? if they came like that from DPS then we need to know the file
names. Or is it an error on our side.
DPS has confirmed
that the below ssns are correct however if you see in the Felon Match
comparison screen they are different. From where are we getting those
incorrect ssns??
TDL# 34871810 - Robert Laegel
SSN# 593-17-4425
TDL# 24117466 - Andrew Vastine
SSN# 634-18-4851
TDL# 37878900 - Brendan Wisely
SSN# 608-02-3712
The Felon Match Comparison screens below show INCORRECT ssns. Why?
TE Edit - I found another case of this in Bexar.
SSN came from the DPS in Felon files. Provided felon file where the those SSN's came.

Brittany has indicated that Waive and Unwaive should not longer be a valid option for WV CF Reports.
I have attached her emails, but I think we will need to get a more formal written request from her to remove this functionality. It was functionality that was specifically entered for WV, now she says they can't use it.
This is an application change and can not be completed as an SQL Change so it can't be completed now.

Data fix

Martha Currier is wanting a list of emails that have been sent out from the system.
I am sending an email back to her needing more clarification on what emails are being sent.
I've requested from Sean verification of "Who" receives the Filing Due Reminder Emails, and the Late Filing Notifications. And the email address of where those email are begin sent from. He's also checking to see if Maine is being Cc'd on the emails.
I provided Martha with what information that I came up with from the Correspondence Document, and Sean provided me with the rest of the info. Without knowing exactly what information Martha was looking for, I sent an email with notification information, but nothing for a specific candidate or committee.
Reply from Martha was Thanks, This answers all of my questions.
Email is attached.
Closing this ticket.

NM expects to be able to send out notifications to PFDS filers as they do to Lobbying and CFIS filers. The design on the FDS module does not include managing notification batches, so the expectation is that notifications should go out without user intervention as configured in the notification templates contained in the notification schedules. In particular, two schedules should be working - "Notifications" tied to the filing cycle start date, and "Filing Notices" tied to the report due dates.
For the "Notifications" schedule tied to the filing cycle, NM expects to be able to send out a notification to all
active
filers that are enrolled in a particular cycle X days after the start date of that cycle. This will be used to notify filers that a new cycle will be starting and there will be new filing obligations for the upcoming cycle. This will be sent out late in the current cycle, 300+ days after the cycle start date.
For the "Filing Notices" tied to filing obligations, NM expects to be able to send out courtesy notices to active filers who have an upcoming, unfiled report as well as late notices to active filers who have a past due report yet to file.
Monday item:
https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/742061987/pulses/6119860984
Part 1: Filing Cycle Notifications
Log into the FDS module as an admin user
Go to Notifications
Select the Notifications schedule
Ensure that you have a template configured to go out on the day that you are testing (change the Send On to the appropriate number of days after the current cycle start date - Jan 1 of current year)
(Have a developer) Fire off the stored procedure that generates the notifications
Expected Results
All filers who are active and included in the cycle will get the notification in their Correspondence tab and emails will be sent to the appropriate destinations (test mailbox for test environments, filer's emails for production)
Actual Results
Copies of correspondence not found in Correspondence tab for expected filers. No emails sent to appropriate destinations.
Part 2: Filing Notices
Log into the FDS module as an admin user
Register new filers of each type - Employee, Appointee, Candidate setting the appropriate start/qualification date so that a report is due on a known date for each filer. Ensure some are past due.
Validate the due dates of the reports
Go to Notifications
Select the Filing Notices schedule
Ensure that you have a courtesy notice template (for reports not yet due) configured to go out on the day that you are testing (change the Send On to the appropriate number of days before the report due date)
Ensure that you have a late notice template (for reports past due) configured to go out on the day that you are testing (change the Send On to the appropriate number of days after the report due date)
(Have a developer) Fire off the stored procedure that generates the notifications
Expected Results
All filers who are active and have an upcoming report due in the set number of days will get the notification in their Correspondence tab and emails will be sent to the appropriate destinations (test mailbox for test environments, filer's emails for production)
All filers who are active and have an overdue report past due the set number of days will get the notification in their Correspondence tab and emails will be sent to the appropriate destinations (test mailbox for test environments, filer's emails for production)
Actual Results
Copies of correspondence not found in Correspondence tab for expected filers. No emails sent to appropriate destinations.

Steps:
Login as Committee above
Navigate to the Menu and select Enter Loan Payments
Payment Filing Period is 1/15/2025 Annual
Loan Type: Candidate Loan Payment
Select loan
Expand the Fund Type
Expected results:
The outstanding balance of $12,261.82 should be available to pay. The $62,738.18 paid loan should show as a payment.
Screenshots:
Loan balance entry was somehow not created when the candidate entered in the loan, resulting in the $0 balance.

The above committee registered with us on 07/19/2024 as a ballot issue committee. For some reason, the CRIS-generated New Officer Memo thinks their next report should be due in the year 3001 instead of them being on this reporting cycle.

The application has an issue where the date format displayed in the calendar widget does not match the expected format for date fields. While the date field is specified to follow the format
mm/dd/yyyy
, the calendar widget displays the selected date in the format
m/dd/yyyy
. This discrepancy is present across the entire application.
Navigate to any date field within the application.
Click on the calendar icon adjacent to the date field to open the calendar widget.
Select a date from the calendar widget.
Look at the date format in the date field after selection.
POLL WORKER has not been implemented yet. Closing the bug.

11The application has a formatting issue in date range fields. The calendar widget used to select dates in these fields displays the date in the format
m/dd/yyyy
, whereas the expected format is
mm/dd/yyyy
. This issue is consistent across all instances of date range fields in the application.
Navigate to any date range field within the application.
Click on the calendar icon adjacent to either the start or end date input field to open the calendar widget.
Select a date from the calendar widget.
Look at the date format in the date range fields after selection.
Added a global constant to format parsed and displayed values to match ticket and existing mm/dd/yyyy. Date range pickers are very similar, we might be able to refactor into a reusable component.

We need to add in a street to all of the counties transitioning that will have a range of 1 to 9999 that will be listed as OUT OF COUNTY.

Our team recently received a redaction request from Natalie Menten. Natalie asked that we redact her campaign records as well as her contribution and expenditure transactions. I have redacted the campaign records internally, but I wanted to ask for your help with her transaction records. Will you please redact the 21 contributions and 101 expenditures identified in the attached document? The contributions and expenditures are broken out in separate tabs.
Also, will you please conduct a system-wide search for her address and let me know if her residential address appears elsewhere in TRACER? Her residential address is:
1755 S Carr Street
Lakewood, CO 80232
Please replace the address data with the following:
Redacted by SOS
Redacted by SOS, CO 99999
Thank you for your help and please let me know if there are any other details I can provide.

Emails from Ric - Users that are associated with multiple orgs, when logging in and selecting any option other than the 1st option are having issues.
We seem to be having a problem with users whose names are associated with multiple organizations.
Please refer to Key#s
7484
,
9764
and
9922
When the user logins they have more than 1 option to click because they are associated with more than 1 organization.
It seems that if they click the first option, there is no problem.
If they click the 2
nd
, or another option, they are directed to either the wrong, but associated campaign, or get directed to an old Account Status page (see below).
2nd Email -
An addendum….
Apparently, this issue has appeared for some first-time users too.
Louise Dinsmore (Key # 9798)
Andrew Dimitri (Key # 9740)
Both of them had 2 choices when logging in and when clicking the 2
nd
option, got the identical Account Status page as the one captured below (Ending Balance as of 10/10/2022 $16.06) even though established their organizations in 2024.
From this morning
Below is another example of a user seeing 2 organizations when they login.
The system says “Multiple Organizations – Please select one”, but there he is only associated with 1 organization…his own.
There were two issues:
1) If the user had another browser window open, and closed their application browser window without logging out, the cookies were not getting cleared. I fixed this issue by clearing cookies on the Login page.
2) Users who served as more than one officer type for a committee (such as a candidate serving as his own treasurer) were seeing their committee name multiple times on the Multiple Organization selection page. I fixed this issue by adding "Distinct" to the queries that pull this information.
This has been deployed to Production and all other environments, and the client has been notified of the fix.

Issue: This issue appears to be in PROD only
Regions are logging voted absentee ballots Activities>Absentee, Early and Questioned Ballots > Process Voted Absentee Ballots. They then pull open the voter. When the voter screen is opened in the Ballot Details it shows a count code of A already in the accept. Because there is not date received, we know that this ballot has not been logged yet.
If you click on the edit pen, then it disappears, and they can log the code.
This is happening to all voters with a sent ballot for all types.
Applied fix to present the correct information on the details

Issue: There are not many combinations of default values to get to the next screen in order to process the voted absentee ballots, if you choose a region, and then choose a district, and you click save, it de-selects the region and then prompts you to pick one in order to move to the next screen, and then when you select a region, it de-selects the district and prompts you to pick one again

@Arpitha Kommareddy
identified an issue with what was being presented for Principal "ASTRAZENECA PHARMACEUTICALS, LP" who has ID = 16989 from the current conversion run in QA. It appears there are no Lobbyist relations but the data shows differently.
The data shows the Principal has 13 Lobbyist relations for year 2023 (3 of the 13 are amended; only 10 unique Lobbyist relations in 2023) and 15 Lobbyist relations for year 2024
(5 of the 15 are amended; only 10 unique Lobbyist relations in 2023)
. For each set of relationship records the data presented is as sent by the client where they are providing the current set of relations for a given registration year. Conversion needs to be updated so that these relations show as being related to the max version of the Principal per registration year... that is, where 1 put 3 and where 4 put 7. Given this is conversion, the full set of relations per Principal version is not necessary (that is, the set of 2023 relations only require a set for version 3 and not for versions 1, 2, and 3).
Looks good now in QA.

Bastrop brought to our attention that there are voters currently listed on the

list
that are individuals who have been identified as suppressed voters,
despite not being originally included in this list. Bastrop has not
implemented any changes to the streets that voters are tied to. They
would like to know why the sudden appearance of these voters on the
99999 list.
Additionally, it is worth mentioning that not all
suppressed voters are experiencing this discrepancy in their records.
They would appreciate any clarification or insights we could provide
regarding this matter.

HSTS Missing From HTTPS Server (RFC 6797)
The remote web server is not enforcing HSTS, as defined by RFC 6797. HSTS
is an optional response header that can be configured on the server to
instruct the browser to only communicate via HTTPS. The lack of HSTS allows
downgrade attacks, SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle attacks, and weakens
cookie-hijacking protections.
Configure the remote web server to use HSTS.

SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted
The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as
stated below :
- First, the top of the certificate
chain sent by the
server might not
be descended from a known public
certificate authority. This can occur either when the
top of the chain is an unrecognized,
self-signed
certificate, or when
intermediate certificates are
missing that would connect the top of the certificate
chain to a known public certificate
authority.
- Second, the certificate chain may
contain a certificate
that is not
valid at the time of the scan. This can
occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or
after one of the
certificate's
'notAfter' dates.
- Third, the certificate chain may
contain a signature
that either
didn't match the certificate's information
or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
getting the certificate with the bad
signature to be
re-signed by its
issuer. Signatures that could not be
verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
using a signing algorithm that Nessus
either does not
support or does not
recognize.
If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain
makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of
the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle
attacks against the remote host.

Backup Files Disclosure
By appending various suffixes (ie: .old, .bak, ~, etc...) to
the names of various files on the remote host, it seems possible to retrieve
their contents, which may result in disclosure of sensitive information.
Ensure the files do not contain any sensitive information,
such as credentials to connect to a database, and delete or protect those
files that should not be accessible.

SSL Self-Signed Certificate
The X.509 certificate chain for
this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.
If the remote host is a public host in
production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a
man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.
Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end in a
certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an unrecognized
certificate authority.
Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this

A voter from Wilbarger cannot use our FPCA Ballot Tracker.
The
voter has a dash in their last name...could that be the reason it's not

found. We tried the tracker with another FPCA from Wilbarger and it was
successful.

This is the message that appears when we try to look up the voter, HONOR ELIZABETH SCHULTE-USUI.
Application is in received status.
We tested a different voter and had no issue: SCHWARTZ ANDREW.
Fixed by the FPCA update.

As an SVRS user
I want to have the voter participation edited in Upshur county
So that voter
000870410
has the correct voter participation history recorded
AC: In PROD, A backend addition for Upshur county voter
000870410
voter participation history, the voter should have credit for the 1992 General election (11/03/1992)
Notes from WV: Can I request a backend addition of voter participation, please?
Upshur County is attempting to credit voter 000870410 for the 1992 General Election (11/03/1992). (Voter Mgmt > Election Participation History > Other Voter Participation) She has tried selecting the ’92 General from the dropdown, and it pre-populates “General” in the Election Type field which is correct. But when she clicks to add the history, it shows as Primary in the listed participation instead of General. There are two 1992 Generals in the drop down menu, and she tried both yielding the same results. Hopefully that made sense.
I would attempt myself, but cannot do so since this is PROD.

AC: Update the attached list of Grant County voters so that their Counted column shows "YES" instead of "NO" for their election participation for the 2024 Primary Election
Notes from WV:
Attached are a list of Grant County voters who need their “Counted” column in SVRS to show as “YES” instead of “NO,” under their election participation. These provisionals were counted at canvass.
Voters participation record updated

As an SVRS User
I want to investigate why Monongalia is seeing discrepancies in the totals for reports
So that we can determine the cause and fix it so the reports show the correct numbers
AC: Investigate the cause and fix the total numbers of voters with various criteria in the voter reports
Notes from WV:
Monongalia County is seeing some discrepancies in their totals. I’ve included my notes in a Word Doc, as well as the applicable reports. When time allows, can someone review and help me identify why the totals do not match? This was difficult to analyze, so forgive me if I have made any clerical errors.
I have also noticed when the user generates an absentee report and selects “UOCAVA Ballot” from the reason code list, it shows ALL absentees – not just UOCAVA.
I ran some reports to audit our voter history totals in SVRS to our official results, and I am getting different numbers on the reports.
For example:
We ended the election with the following totals:
Election Day voters = 11097
Early Voters = 6244
Absentee Voters = 339
Counted Provisionals = 33
Not counted provisionals = 50
Total = 17713
When I ran a voter participation report PDF in SVRSv9 = 17750
I ran an excel file so I could sort and try and determine where the numbers were off and got a total of 17751 voters on the excel file.
As best I can tell:
currently on
Should have in SVRS Connect
Election Day (includes provisionals) 11130 11162 11169
Early Voting 6244 6251 6243
Absentee 339 338 279
We had approximately 22 permanent absentee voters that we mailed on the first day of absentee voting for 24P. Currently the report has 30 permanent absentee voters.
When I run a report of UOCAVA voters, it retrieves 391 voters. I ran this twice to make sure I was not doing something wrong (I chose the 2024 Primary and UOCAVA) and got the same 391 result both times, as if it was retrieving all absentees from the 2024P.
If you have reports on your end that can help determine where the discrepancies are, that would be great. The only two types of voter history that our office entered manually was the absentees and the provisionals. We cannot run a report out of SVRS that queries just on if it was a provisional ballot or not. If you can run a report of provisional voter history status (counted and not counted), then we can audit against our provisionals. Our absentees are one off, which I will try and see if we can determine who that is. The Early Voting and Election Day was uploaded from Connect digitally and that seems to be where the numbers differ.
I am attaching my certification of what the voter history should be for the 2024 Primary.
Previously UOCAVA voters are not getting filtered out properly in absentee reports.
Fixed Voter participation history report by adding fl_couted ='n' and the 'order by' was not properly defined as per the selected column

When trying to amend the date for an individual of an LLC contribution and saving it or trying to delete the record, TRACER logged us off.
The DFA was entering an LLC contribution and made a data entry error. The contribution date should’ve been 06-21-2024 but was entered as 06-21-2022. They were expecting TRACER to generate a major contributor report as the amount and date would’ve have generated a major contributor report. The DFA realized that the data entry error and tried to correct the date by clicking on the Update link for the contribution, then updated the year from 2022 to 2024, and when they went to save the update, TRACER errored out. It appears the change in the date of the contribution didn’t hold but apparently it did generate major contributor reports for 2024. The DFA tried a second time to correct things and the same thing happened.
Brett, Cathy, and I initially didn’t understand what steps the DFA had taken as the DFA hadn’t originally sent us a screen print of the application error. We decided to try and duplicate the potential issue using Sandbox before calling the DFA back. We entered an LLC contribution with the incorrect date and then used the Update link to correct the date and it worked as expected (changed the date and generated an MC rpt.). We then entered a second LLC contribution with an incorrect date and instead of using the Update link, we used the Delete link and then re-entered with the correct date and Sandbox worked as expected – generating an MC report.
Next, we called the DFA and asked what steps they used to try and correct the data entry error and they walked us through their steps which was using the Update link to get back into the transaction and change the date and save the update. When they did this, they said they received an application error. At that point we asked the DFA to send us a screen print and we asked if they would okay with CPF staff trying to use the Update link a make the correction. The DFA gave authorization and Cathy attempted to do this, and she received the same error the DFA did.
So, I’m not sure why production is producing an application error in this process. And I’m not sure why CPF staff got different results in Sandbox and Production.
I can't see anything that needs to be done. Looks ok to me.

Planned Parenthood PAC had a promised contribution that didn’t come in that was reported on the 42 Day Post Primary Report. They deleted it, but it is still showing up on that report, which messes with the balance.
Contribution dated 6/8/2024 Monetary(Itemized) from Daniel and Sheryl Tishman, in the amount of $25,000.00.
Contribution was Deleted on 6/8/2024 as well.
Contribution shows as being deleted.
24 Hr Report of Contributions was Filed on 6/8/2024 @ 1:17:42 PM, then after the Contribution was deleted, the 24 Hr Report was Amended on 8/5/2024 @ 12:48:52 PM.
That report is correct, it shows the contribution as being deleted.
But the 42-Day Post Primary Report - showing as filed on 7/22/2024 picked up the transaction, that shows as deleted on 6/8/2024.
No way to amend the 42-Day Post-Primary Report - because there are no action items on the Contribution, since it is showing as deleted.
Both Reports are attached.
Martha
–
For
some reason, the original delete of that transaction didn’t trigger a refile of
the 42-Day Post-Primary report. There isn’t any way to force the
Amendment other than to edit one of the transactions that appeared on that
report (the actual DELETED transaction, does not include a link for an
amendment, since it’s been deleted), so we selected another contribution to
edit so that would force the refile (Amendment).
A
contribution dated 6/7/2024 from Margot and Roger Milliken in the amount of
$5,000.00 was updated. Nothing was changed on the
transaction.
That
triggered a refile required for the 24-Hr Report of Contributions that was due
on 6/8/2024. It was refiled. Report totals are the same, the refile
shows the original transaction and the update with no changes.
Since
that transaction was also filed on the 42-Day Post-Primary Report, it triggered
a refile required for that report as well (which was the original goal).
The PREVIEW of that Report Refile, was picking up the deleted contribution from
Daniel and Sheryl Tishman on 6/8/2024 in the amount of $25,000.00. That
Amendment was then refiled.
That
refile, triggered an auto amendment of the Committee October Quarterly
(7/17/2024 – 9/30/2024).
There
is a Refile Required for the 2-Day Pre-General IE Report for 10/4/2024, that
has nothing to do with the transaction above, so we left that one
alone. The committee can re-file that when they are ready.
Cash
Balance at Beginning of Period (189,641.02) on the PREVIEW of the 11-Day
Pre-General Report, matches with the Cash Balance at End of Period,
(189,641.02) on the Committee October Quarterly, now, which is $25,000.00 less
than it was so I think everything looks good.
Hope
this helps!

Need to create a new filing cycle in the Lobbyist Module in NM QA to be able to test what happens when an existing Lobbyist or Employer renews their registration. This requires creating a 2025 Filing cycle and that is currently blocked with a RedX error on attempting to save a new filing cycle.

I want to have the following changes made in Wetzel county
So that Wileyville and Reader have the correct street information
AC: Update both Ashland Ridge Rd (Pineville) and Ashland Ridge Rd (Reader) with the below information
Notes from WV:
A few change requests from Wetzel County:
Ashland Ridge Rd (Pineville) needs to be in the city of Wileyville.
The majority of the street information on Ashland Ridge Rd. is incorrect, so below are the items that we need corrected. Please let me know if there is anything the user can change on their end. Upon my initial review, I did not think they had the ability to make such edits without the redistricting module.
Currently shows as:
ALL 744 – 1559 (pct. 21, combo 37)
ALL 1667 – 1667 (pct. 4, combo 8)
Should be:
ALL 774 – 774 (pct. 18, combo 34)
Wileyville
The zip code for this segment needs to be 26587 instead of 26419.
NOTE: there are 2 voters currently registered at 744, and the clerk’s office finds to be in error. They are fixing this now to reflect 774, as to not displace voters outside of the correct, proposed high low range once this backend fix is made).
ALL 1379 – 2783 (pct. 16, combo 16)
Wileyville
The zip code should be 26581 instead of 26419.
Ashland Ridge Rd. (Reader) needs a high/low adjustment. The precinct and combo for this one will remain the same.
Currently shows as:
ALL 2783 – 7605 (pct. 16, combo 16)
Should be:
ALL 2902 – 7781 (pct. 16, combo 16)

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to use the "Change County" button
So that voters can be moved to the correct counties without having to create a new data ticket for each specific voter
AC: The Change County button when processing OVR's and DMV's should correctly send the selected voter to the desired county
Notes from WV:
When processing OVRs and DMVs, counties are unable to select “Change County.”
Recently, it was reported that the “Change County” button was not working when counties need to send DMVs/OVRs to other counties. However, we were unable to test in PROD since the reporting county had sent it back to the state. We have an example currently in Taylor County’s queue – OVR voter Sydni Suzanne Summers.
When the county user clicks the change county button, nothing happens. I tried on my end, and I am seeing the same result. Can you please take a look? Please let me know your findings, as I want to ensure Preston County receives this record in a timely fashion.
Not reproduceable in SIT. It's working as expected in SIT.

Something is oddly causing many valid early votes to be “canceled”. We have not been able to produce the actual chain of events… but is already impacted almost a hundred voters. Our current solution is just for me to go in behind the scenes and unflag them as being canceled (Just changing the CD_BALLOT_REQ_TYPE=NULL for those with a C that were incorrectly given a C.) I have a list of all those that I have changed.
If that temporary solution is a problem, let us know as soon as you can. This should be a top priority bug… as it is bound to get worse.
Process Early Ballots has logic to cancel a ballot when the page is unloaded, which appears to be linked to a confirmation prompt to save changes. This prompt no longer appears, but ballots are still cancelled by performing these steps:
Navigate to Process Early Ballots, enter default values, and search for a voter
Select the voter's district and click save; click OK on confirmation message
Click "Print Certification Notice"
Click "Back" to navigate away from Process Early Ballots
Ballot is now flagged as "Canceled"
Code change to remove unused methods that are canceling early votes when page is unloaded.

I want street segments in Ohio County to be edited
So that they display the correct street information
AC: Remove the incorrect street segment information for McGraws Run Rd (Valley Grove)
Notes from WV: Can we possibly get a backend fix in Ohio County? They have two identical segments – one correct, and one with incorrect voting details (house district and precinct). Currently, here is what we have:
McGraws Run Rd. (Valley Grove)
ALL 30 – 3323 (Pct. 161A, combo 00031). CORRECT
ALL 30 – 3323 (Pct. 158A, combo 00067). INCORRECT
Ideally, we’d like there to be only one segment:
McGraws Run. Rd (Valley Grove)
ALL 30 – 3323 (Pct. 161A, combo 00031)
I have updated voting details and removed the segment.

This public financing committee can't appear to file a closure report because public matching funds reports are populating. I remember sending her a pdf report Sean generated for me.

While testing 68702 - When filing, not Importing Information from the Previous Year filing.
That seems to be working now, but when I click to file the report, it says it's filed, but it still shows up as Unfiled on the Unfiled Reports page as well as the Home Page Immediate to do List.
I found that I can no longer FILE a report in QA or UAT.
Started testing in QA
with Watson, the testing of the bug where when clicking the Import from previous year, wasn't bringing in the Filer Details info, is now working, but there is a new strange issue. When the report is FILED, it is showing up on the Filed Reports, page as filed, but it is showing up on the Home page under the Immediate to Do list, as not being filed, and the option to FILE the report is still there. I worked with Sean and Parker on this for a while, Parker needs to do some investigation on what is going on. It doesn't seem to be anything that has to do with Sean's bug fix, but this is
NOT happening in PROD! It's going back to Sean, but it's not longer a Critical Issue. All SOSOI filings for the year should be completed by now. There are no additional filings until the 2024 Statements due in 2025.

Since the backup was after she had already filed, I unfiled her report, and then Cleared the Statement so I could check it in with the Original Check-in Date of 4/12/2024.
Check-In puts the filing in Pending Checked -In Status. So I no longer get the option to pull in from the last filing. I can only click RESUME. When I do that the Filer Details Section is blank the first time. Then when you go out and come back in and click RESUME, the Filer Details are filled in.
Cleared Statement again, now the Statement has a status of Unfiled. When I click Begin Statement, and then click IMPORT YOUR INFORMATION FROM PREVIOUS YEAR the Filer Detail Informaion is there. However the Statement is not showing as filed on the Filer Home page. It still shows in the Immediate To Do - List. It is showing as filed if you look at the View/File Statements Page.
Patrick C Keliher Filer ID 363939
- Same for Keliher. In QA this was already filed. I unfiled, the previously filed statement, the Cleared the Statement. They started over clicking Begin Statement. IMPORT and the Filer Details Informaion is there. Check in the Statement with the original File Date of 4/12/2024, then click RESUME, and the Filer Details Information is there, I filed the report - receive the verification that the report has been filed, but when you look on the Immediate To Do - The statement shows as Not Filed, and it is showing as LATE. Under the View/File Statements, it shows as being FILED.

In UAT Only, IIEF registrations are bugged where they show blank, are easily duplicated, and don't show success messages.
Monday Link:
https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/3008114619/pulses/5323179989
1) In AU CFIS UAT, register an IIEF type filer and hit submit
2) Note you only get the warning to check info, never a success message. Submit again.
3) Go in to work as admin and look at pending registrations. Notices there is now a duplicate
4) Attempt to preview the registration, it will open blank.
5) Approve the registration. No action taken by system.
Expected results - iief registration shows success message on submit, preview shows a preview report, and approving the registration from pending approves the user
Actual - iief registration success messaged doesnt display allowing duplicate registrations. Preview reg from pending registrations shows blank, and approving the reg triggers no system action.

Issue: When logging "I" ballots, the wrong sequence number is shown
Additional notes from meeting with Phillip:
Seems to be working for early vote type ballots > search code for updating the ID_Sequence field
when CD_BALLOT_REQ_TYPE is I
Different CD_REQUEST_TYPE get different sequencing outcomes (some of them work, some of them don't)
Both of these were type "I" ballots for the same district, it is unclear if they were consecutive since they happened at 12:00pm and 1:45pm, and it is unclear if this was just the confirmation message showing the wrong sequence number, or if the wrong sequence number was assigned and saved for both
Notes from AK:

Comment: Appx noon on 8-8-24 logging

Email from Kelly - There are several candidates that have skipped filing some CF Reports, then filed reports after that. Will it mess up their totals if they file the report now, after other reports have already been filed with dates after the one skipped.
Example: Org IND 216130 - Needs to file the 2023 4th Quarter Report.
Has already filed the 2024 1st and 2nd Quarter report.
Tired the first candidate. Phillip Mallow ID 216130. Added in the 2023 4th Qtr Report, then filed it.
This one worked since there were no beginning balances on the 1st report they had already filed which was the 2024 1st Qtr Report.
May or may not work if the 1st report the candidate filed, has beginning balances that were entered manually.

This issue required several changes in the UI and the database for missing and inconsistent data. The single FilingInformation.cshtml file has a combination of event triggers during data loading which makes the whole execution very slow. Delays have been added to assign data to some elements making it worse. File is too big to be refactored.
Added missing information that caused some event triggers to fail: Certificate of Status and Certified Copy fees were missing, breaking fee recalculation on edit screen.
Selected Expedite Fee type was commented out at some point, which also affected fee recalculation.
Missing values in those fees were not properly handled causing errors with NaN values.
Changes to radio button options (from Domestic Entity to State Entity, for example), caused issues with specific code not getting executed.

Independent Committees renewals is ignoring, UserJobRole (member & person) versions updates

We are still experiencing issues with loading in imports to train and receiving exports back. It is urgent we complete testing for certain ticket items before we are placed in code freeze in September. Our goal is to release enhancements to our system prior to the General 2024 election. We can load imports, but they are not necessarily sending back exports. The import I sent on 8/14 had a total of 2,649 records. Only an error export was returned with the same number of records which I find odd for every record to have an error. I sent off a smaller import of only 16 records yesterday and it has yet to shoot back an export. Can your team please continue to investigate this issue. Thank you.

CO is requesting a Sandbox Data Refresh prior to the next Filing Period, which starts September 3, 2024.
The Sandbox database has been refreshed.

The public dashboard and explore grid are showing the wrong amounts for Political Contributions in some circumstances, and they don't match the values on the report.
The following numbers are wrong when compared to the filed report:
And here is the filed report with the accurate number:
Login to QA and create a new lobbyist.
Accept the registration and work on behalf of the new lobbyist.
Click on the Reports tab and click 'File Unscheduled Report'
Choose First/Second/Third Lobbyist Expenditure Report
Add a political contribution
Back out of the report
Edit the same report
Add another political contribution with the same information, but a different dollar amount.
Back out of the report
File the report
This will create two lines in the database for two different amounts, but only the first amount should get counted. Instead, both amounts are getting tallied on the dashboard and Explore page.
Changed queries back to only selecting the most recent PC for each contribution

Use the same Name in Foreign Name Availability Search tab as the D-LLC Name
Click Search, and see that there are no name conflicts
Go to the next tab
Current functionality: Rejection validation message indicates a name conflict
Expected functionality: Rejection validation message shouldn't pop up if there is no name conflict
(Note from Cherie: As far as I can tell, it's only conversion from D-LLC to F-LLC that this is happening on)

Complete the application for a Name Reservation (online or inhouse)
Complete the formation of another entity, using the reservation code supplied from the Name Reservation formation
Go to Entity Search and search the entity by name
Current Functionality: Status and Status Details for Name Reservation remain as Active/Current
Expected Functionality: Status should be updated to Inactive, Status Details should be updated to Inactive/Claimed

When updating properties as an admin from the
Correspondence / Document Images tab, the system incorrectly redirects the user back to the principal tab instead of staying on the
Correspondence / Document Images.
Environment: GA and DAD LRS QA, UAT
Filer ID:
Steps:
Register a new lobbyist or use an existing lobbyist
Go to the lobbyist dashboard >Correspondence / Document Images>
Scenario # 1:
Click on actions to select
Update Properties then click on UPDATE button
Scenario # 2:
Click on upload button to fill out upload image popup screen
then click on IMPORT button
Expected Results: The user should remain on the "
Correspondence / Document Images" Tab after the properties are updated.
Actual Results: The system redirects the user to the Client tab instead of the
Correspondence / Document Images.

After updating it return to principal tab

Log in online and start a Name Reservation
After beginning Name Reservation Processing, and selecting the name, and getting all the way to the end (but don't complete the payment yet), have someone else log in online and start a Name Reservation with the same name
Have the second person complete their filing first
Then have the first person submit the payment for their filing
Current functionality: Both Name Reservations are being allowed
Expected functionality: Only the first completed (paid for) application should be allowed, so the second one should not have been allowed

Log in inhouse or online
Find an LLC in the system that is current/active and has a future Name Held Date
Create a new formation filing for a Domestic Limited Liability Company > Certificate of Organization
In the Name Availability Search tab, search the
same name
including identifier as the existing entity and see that the other entity is returned as a conflict
Next, do another search for the same exact name, but use LC as the identifier
Current functionality: When LC is used as an identifier, the existing name is not returned as conflicting
Expected functionality: Identifier should not make the name distinguishable, so even with LC, it should return the name as a conflict

Create a Work Order for an entity with an apostrophe in the name
Go to edit the Work Order
Current Functionality: On the Edit Work Order page, system does not allow you to click Edit button (pencil) - I believe it's because of the apostrophe in the name (we should make sure this works for any other special characters as well, including commas, periods, dollar signs, percent signs, ampersands, at sign, etc)
Expected Functionality: System should allow work order to be created
Additional note from UT:
For work orders that have already been entered into the system, there is an issue with updating the scanned file. When you try to replace the scanned file with an updated file, there is an error that appears for a page miscount, which disables the ability to process it.
The only way to work around this is to upload the updated file, and keep the old scanned file. So when the work order is processed, you have both the old scan (which would have been rejected), and the new upload (the corrected version).
Basically, there is no way to replace the file that was already scanned in the work order with an updated file, without it leading to an error. You can only add a file and process the work order with both files.
This was resolved as part of a different task

Log in online
Complete a formation filing for any entity
Current functionality:
When a filing is completed online, there are two instances of the Stamped File Copy added as correspondence. Additionally, the Correspondence date/time is incorrect.
Expected functionality:
When a filing is completed online, there should only be one instance of the Stamped File Copy added as correspondence. Additionally, the Correspondence date/time should be from the date/time it was actually sent instead of 12:00 AM.

Steps:
Register a lobbyist in DAD-QA and pay all fees.
Authorize the lobbyist as the principal.
Work on behalf of the lobbyist and backdate the end date and due date of the most recent report to before the current date.
Make sure the fine service is running every few minutes.
Wait for the fine service to run and check the Fees and Fines tab of the lobbyist's dashboard.

Expected Results: Event log should display the fine accrued.
Actual Results: Event log displays: "System Administrator has assessed a fine of $0.00 associated with Lobbyist 2024 Expenditure Report."
The fine is not displayed on the fees and dine tab either

I want to have UOCAVA voters included in absentee reports
So that the absentee reports show all absentee voters accurately
AC: UOCAVA voters should be included in absentee reports if the UOCAVA Ballot reason code is picked as report criteria
Notes from WV:
Pocahontas County reported that if criteria is used when generating an absentee report, UOCAVA voters are being left off. This was previously an issue, but it appears to be back:
https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/753893993/pulses/6335067074
Above is what criteria was used, and attached are reports. The first one was generated with criteria and includes 22 voters. However, it is excluding voters 100689605 and 100996917. The second one is without criteria, which includes 24 voters – this is the correct report.

Today we encountered something odd in the system. A committee called Trussville Together was able to opt into an old 2022 election calendar called “
SPECIAL SCHOOL TAX ELECTION - GARDENDALE, MIDFIELD, TRUSSVILLE” but the thing that we do not understand is that they were able to file a current weekly report for last week. I thought the last possible report that could be filed with this election cycle was an April 11, 2022 Daily report or a weekly report due by April 11, 2022.
They were given a period begin date of 8/12/2024 and a period end date of 8/16/2024 due by 8/19/2024. Is there anything we should have turned off or input to stop this from happening?
If a committee is able to add their own dates to our calendars there is a potential to bypass the law and make it where they fly under the radar to not get penalized.
Any insight on this will be very helpful. Thank you so much!

Here's an example of the issue. This data is in DAD QA. The lobbyist renewed or something ... both of these show up on the EventLog table...
and as a result, instead of updating the existing UserJobRole table record to have the new MemberVersionID and new PersonVersionID, the process created a completely new UserJobRole record... should only be one UserJobRole record for a given MemberID/PersonID combo... thanks!
Same DB... this MemberID/PersonID combo has 3 records on UserJobRole...

Amended his Current Registration to update his email address to his gmail account. Amendment was filed on 8/27/2024.
The Email address is changed everywhere, but it it not showing correctly on the Admin Page, in the Committee Email Section. That is still showing the email @ATT.NET.
Amended/Correct Registration, do not show any other place to correct the email.
The only thing that looks funky is the check box on the amendment Candidate is only officer is checked. I did a correction, unchecked and rechecked that check box, still showing the Committee email as the ATT.NET, and not the Gmail account.
I checked the User record for Humphries and the PFD records, both places the email looks good.
The problem was that candidate committee addresses are stored in a different field in the Organization table, and that field wasn't getting updated during amendment/correction process. This issue has been fixed. (Note: this does not include a data fix; another amendment/correction will need to be performed to correct this for committees that currently have this issue).

Is it possible to append the Mailing addresses to absentees for a county that just came online?
County says that for some reason the previous upload did not contain the mailing addresses for these applications.
I am attaching the file with the mailing addresses here.
We did data fix

Kevin explained: The candidate record has a key value for person_phone_uid, but that guid has not been inserted into the person_phone table. In the past elections we told the county user to remove the phone number. Rafferty confirmed that removing the phone number allowed the county to save the filing. See attached email thread.

2 issues that need to be resolved Statewide Immediately.
#1
Appears that for Annual Abbms / FPCAs the local elections available in
the county are appending to the voters whether or not the voter belongs
in the specific district. The below voter is in the DISD school
district. The Woden ISD election should have not appended to this voter.
#2 Because of the issue above, voters that
are not in the WISD school district
are appearing in the FPCA/ABBM report that was run for the 2024 NOVEMBER
WODEN ISD
.
This situation has happened in prior elections, has been fixed and is happening again.
The FPCA/ABBM Report should only pull voters tied to the districts on those elections.
Examples below:
1028784808
1028939357
1206383432
Deleted the absentee ballots that are not part of school district WISD with below query
delete from absentee_ballot where id_election=50656 and id_minor_combo not in (
select distinct id_minor_combo from ss_minor_combo_districts where id_town=174 and nb_district = 'WISD');

We currently provide an export on the FTP called __VIEW_ABS_BALLOT_2024Primary. WV needs some changes to this export.
AC:
The export will contain data for the 2024 General Election (updated from the Primary)
The name will be changed to reflect to the export is for the General election (

The following fields/columns will be added:

Created missing view in prod database (which is only applicable for Prod) .

After Deployment of CR Item @ 66341 to UAT - Additional Items were requested. It was agreed that Civix will implement the following three items at no additional cost.
Add an option for
Replacing
: Address and Phone Number for Candidate/Contributor.
Add an
Event Log
entry that will capture what change was made, date/time of the change and the user making the redaction.
Add an
option to redact Employer/Occupation
fields when redacting Contributor Information.
Email from Christy Wilson attached.
These changes have been completed and hotfixed to the UAT environment.

Client process is to generate an export of Notification batches for review prior to sending them. On 8/23/24 they generated two notification batches in Prod and tried to export them. The system popped up a new tab as designed and displayed a spinner while attempting to generate the export. Eventually the spinner went away and the tab was blank instead of a PDF being displayed. This is related to the size of the notification batch and can be recreated in UAT/QA with a sufficiently large batch on notifications.1
In UAT
Login to CFIS module
Go to Notification Administration
Choose Manage Notification Batches
Sort on create date
Select batch "
BF 8220240502003005" (created 5/2/24, sent 5/9/24)
From the action menu for this record select Export.
Select to radio button to select all recipients.
Click the Export button
Expected Result
System should open a new tab, process for a time while displaying a spinner, and then display a PDF of the notifications included in the exported batch
Actual Result
System spins for a time and then displays a spinner in a new tab and, after a minute or two, clears the spinner displaying an empty browser tab.
NOTE
- Will find the size of the batch (number of recipients) that currently fails and find others of similar sizes for testing purposes in QA.

Validation:
Verify that selecting a street segment correctly triggers the display of registered voters in the voter grid.
Real-Time Data Display:
Real-Time Updates:
The voter grid should be populated with voter information in real-time, reflecting the most up-to-date data from the system.

Issue reported by GA, Monday.com comments:
Data entered by Admin, are not being saved.
GA:
This lobbyist has had password reset issues in the past. I have worked directly with him with the temporary passwords that are sent out for password reset from the system and they don't work for him at the login page.
I was able to type in a password at the User Administration screen in the past and that password would work, but no longer.
I notice when I click "Save" the splash screen doesn't close like it should. See picture below.
This lobbyist needs to be able to log in soon to do his reporting. Thank you.

The system did not pick up missing employer information for this committee on $500 and over transactions on the 8/27 Pre General 1 report.
Employer information is required by law to be entered when a $500 or more transactions is made. The system should of flagged each of those transactions $500 and over as non-compliant.

Did they system require you to add employer information?
Did the system mark that with a red flag as non-compliant if not entered?
Expected Results:
System should require the Employer Information and if not entered then the system should mark that as non-compliant
Actual Results:
System allowed this report to be filed without the employers information and did not flag the non compliant transactions.
Clients Requests:
We need to run a query to see if anyone else was effected by this so that they can notify the committees?
Can we mark those transactions $500 or more as non-compliant and give them a red flag dated back to the date of the transaction on the backend?
@Gordon Crawford
@Dara Johnson
I ran the attached script to generate the missing transactions for everything from 2023 onwards.
Regarding their audit, I have attached two text files containing committee names and their associated CCF ID. One file contains the list of committees that already had an audit sent out, and have since had new violations generated, and the other file contains committees that did not previously have violations and now need to be sent an audit notice.
In total 353 committees were sent an audit notice on 09/05. Of these 353 commitees, 70 committees will need to have a new audit notice sent out containing new violations that the systems missed. In addition to this, 45 additional committees did not receive an audit notice and should have.

Williamson
County ran their Ballot Style report (
#001161197
) and the BS is starting at BS94 rather than starting at BS2. Can this be fixed on the backend for when they run this report?
Besides the Ballot Styles starting at 94 Williamson County also looks to have duplicate ballot styles throughout their Ballot Style report.
Example below.
When I look at these voters on the street/split screen it looks like the major districts assigned are appearing twice.
The
1
voter assigned
BS94
only shows their major districts once. While the
4784
voters assigned to
BS95
is showing their major districts twice. This is turn is impacting their BS report giving them duplicates.
Deleted the ballot styles from back end and asked county to generate ballot styles again.
Query to delete ballot styles:
delete from ballot_style where id_town=246 and id_election=49664;
After county generated ballot styles again issue resolved.

Issue:
vendor sent by mistake a country code
"US" for some FPCAs instead of the appropriate country code.
Example: 2209840669 - HOOD, JACK LINTON
To try to correct it:
Votec sent his record with the proper country code (CN) and used an application source of "90" and an event type of "99"
but
the linked FPCA mailing address was not updated. The file we sent was: TEAM_SC90_TEST1_09_05_2024_1.zip Reference #: 1148396.
Then, they sent another record with an application source of "99" (Clerical Correction) and an event type of "99" and this time the record was rejected with the error message: "Error Message : Voter not found with TEAM VUID : 2209840669". The file we sent was: TEAM_SC90_TEST2_09_05_2024_2.zip Reference #: 1148449.

So that I have a more accurate general idea of the number of applications received
AC: If possible, identify the following statistics on the backend for WV
Notes from WV:
Is there a way to identify the following statistics on the backend?
The total number of OVRs received by county
The total number of DMVs received by county
The total number of paper applications by county
Ideally, this would be over the course of a month just to get a general idea of the number of applications received (Ex: 8/1/2024 – 8/31/2024). And this is just a one-time request; we wouldn’t need this periodically. If this is not possible, let me know. I can go through each county’s audit report for the month, but I fear that the data would not be 100% accurate, as the audit report shows changes such as voter history, clerical corrections, etc.

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to see Deputy Clerk as an option when adding a role
So that county user worker roles are accurate
AC: When adding a new worker, deputy clerk should show up in the drop down menu when selecting a role
Notes from WV:
Hi Elaine,
We have a new employee here in the office and we have his SVRS account set up. When I was adding his "role" there was no Deputy Clerk role I can select anymore and had to select "county staff".
Having selected County Staff, our new employee cannot work up "New Reg" forms. When he goes to "Voter Management" then "voter search information" it's a screen that comes up that doesn't give him the ability to work a "New Voter" up.
Is there any way we can be able to get the "Deputy Clerk" back in the drop box when we select roles?
Hey Greg,
That’s strange – I can see it on my end. What is the user’s name? I can make the update on my end.
Please see the below email from Kanawha user 020GJONES. In short, he was adding a user and did not see “Deputy Clerk” as a role. In the past, he was able to edit/add users in his role as deputy. I made the change on my end, since I can see the Deputy Clerk role… But why can’t the county user see “Deputy Clerk?”
Did the data fix for deputy clerk making fl_Admin flag to 'Y'

Michelle Called - There are two new offices that they have NEVER had file CF Reports before, but now BRAD thinks they need to file.
One of them is a Supreme Court Justice. They are appointed for at least 2 years, then they must stad for retention at the first statewide general election, and every 10 years after.
This year Mark Massa, Derek Molter and Loretta Rush all are on the ballot for a 10 year retention.
Then there are two Appeals Court District Judges that are up for Election, Peter Foley, Indiana Court of Appeals 1st District, and Rudolph Pyle III Indiana Court of Appeals 4th District.
Court of appeals is divided into 5 districts, 1-3 Southern District, Middle District and Northern District, then 4th & 5th are all counties and consist of three judges one from each of the first three.
Working with Michelle we can set up the Offices, but there isn't a code table to set up districts.
They need Districts 1-5 for Court of Appeals Judges. They do have a District dropdown on their registration form, but apparently that is currently hard coded. I couldn't find any code table to set one up.
** We need to call Michelle when Becky get's back to see what they have decided. Right now they only need to add one Appeals Court Judge, so they might have gone ahead and added it. and entered the District in the Office Description.
I told her this might be a CR, and if it is, we could switch it after they added if that's what they decide.
The Court of Appeals office has been marked as requiring district. The script used is:

Tucker County processed a registration for voter 001059862. He was cancelled, so she edited the existing record to make him active again.. When she printed the cards shown below, it is showing his previous precinct. Prior to redistricting, the street he lives on was in pct. 5. Now, the street is in precinct 4. When I review his record and the street itself, it properly shows precinct 4. But the cards show the old precinct 5 instead of 4. Please advise.

(that has blanks in ballot style
for many voters)
County has run the ballot box multiple times, checked their
streets pending, checked districts assigned, and run voter list with precinct
99999. Still getting same result of no BS assigned for those voters on list.
Data fix.

Issue: Attached is a DMV test batch, AK would like for this to be loaded into the current test environment to determine the env will be functional with the new batches
Notes from AK:
Phillip,
Attached is a voter registration test record which will be produced by the online gateway after making the changes to the voter registration questions. You are still receiving data fields for the removed questions, but those are left blank. I am hoping you can go over the test record and ensure that it will work for the purposes of your agency. Please see the scope document if you have any questions about the changes to the voter registration questions.
Warm regards,

At work order creation, filing fees appear to be caching, which is causing them to show $0 sometimes when there is, in fact, a fee for the service. It seems to happen after a $0 order (dissolution), and then going back in to create a new work order for a filing that does have a fee.
They also can't click "Fee Calculation" to add the fees, because nothing shows up in the pop-up when they click it

The problem was that the email address in the user record did not match the email address in the candidate record (Person table), and the system thought it needed to create a new user record for the candidate. I'm not sure how this happened, but I see that user records are sometimes shared across multiple committees, so that might explain why. The best solution I could come up with is the update the email address in the user record to match the email address in the candidate record. At first I tried (in UAT) to update all of the cases where the user record did not match the candidate record, but found that this posed a problem for the cases where a user record is shared across multiple committees, so I decided that we will need to handle this on an individual basis. I have now updated the data for this committee and believe that fixes the problem.
The script used is:
Update CFISUser
Set Email = 'cfrs97234@wvsos.gv'
Where CFSUserID = 2850

When Accepting Pending Candidate Affidavits or Committee Registrations, Cathy has reported she is receiving this error more frequently. She indicated
"
When this happens, I must go into the TRACER account and set up the schedule. I notice the initial letter doesn’t get sent out as well.
I’m wondering if the officers/candidate get the login credentials."
I have sent for a little more clarification on what she is actually required to do. Manually assign the filing schedule?
I will try in Sandbox, and see if I can recreate this issue.
UNABLE TO REPRODUCE IN SANDBOX. I added 4 new Statewide IE Committees in Sandbox, the first time I accepted the committee I assigned the correct filing schedule (I think). The 2024 2 year Cycle (12/9/2022 - 12/5/2024) I think I selected the 2 Year Cycle for the Statewide IEC Frequent.
The next three times I accepted the registration, I selected the other incorrect filing schedules.
State/County Sch Brd IEC Committee Frequent & County IEC Frequent
I didn't receive any errors even when assigning the incorrect filing schedules.
I expected to receive an error when I assigned a County Filing Schedule to a Statewide Committee, but I didn't receive any errors.
There are several filing schedules that appear in the dropdown when assigning a filing schedule, so I wanted to see what happened when I selected the incorrect one, thinking Cathy might have selected the incorrect one, since there are so many. No error. Below is the list of filing schedules that are currently set up in Sandbox, and it looks the same as PROD.

Issue: When completing an OLVR registration form, if the gender of the voter is left blank, after submitting, it still shows as male on the Summary screen when it should be blank
This is not reproducible in QA because it says it is unable to process the request when attempting to submit
I’m not sure if this explanation below makes sense to you but when voters go into OLVR to submit a registration form, the summary of registration shows that it defaults to male as a gender selection but it appears as though when the actual form comes through to us to process, neither gender options are selected.
See screenshot below of my own information where I left the gender options blank:
In the screen prior to the Summary for printing, whether DMV or paper submission, if the gender is not selected, it is blank.
For some reason when you click Submit and get this Summary page, it is defaulting to Male. That needs to be corrected.
In OLVR
Register online > Begin voter registration > enter personal information for the voter > Next > Enter resident address > next > Do NOT select gender > next > (this registration summary page correctly shows the gender as blank) > Submit > The Summary of Registration page shows the gender as Male when it should be blank like the previous summary

enerated PDF Form B-6 is showing strange dates under Item 2 – Date of Election.
For example, under reports due looking at their 3
rd
filing down from the top, under Item 2 supporting Jason Prokop under Date of Election it shows 12/31/2023. They believe the election should state 11/05/2024 but there is no way to change that. I thought maybe it was pulling from the candidate committee but I was unable to determine where it would be pulling from.
The problem was that the report was pulling the election tied to the most recent campaign for that candidate, and it should instead be tied to the campaign record in effect when the report was filed. (We didn't expect them to change campaigns for candidate committees, but they often do assign a new filing schedule if there are still reports to be filed after the election cycle of their election).

Issue: An OABA batch was processed and the date says a future date
This is kind of a weird one. A voter was processed through an OABA batch VN: 16137759. We were going through an auditing, and when pulling up the documents from OABA after it was processed, it shows the document date as 11/24/2024. Obviously, this date has not happened yet so we are unsure how this could have happened unless VREMS has figured out a way to time travel. Below is a screenshot and I’ll let you know if we run across anymore.

Issue: If a voter record has UOCAVA status applied at some time and then a user tries to remove the status, the edits are not accepted. The end date is not enforced.
Repro Steps:
Search for a voter.
Select Change
Add UOCAVA status to the voter record.
Accept Changes.
Search for the same voter and clear all UOCAVA fields.
Accept Changes.
Search for the same voter.
Note that UOCAVA changes were not saved.
Fig1 Example: I did a change filing to remove UOCAVA status from this voter but on returning to voter, all fields are still populated. My changes were not saved.
FlUocava().equalsIgnoreCase("Y") was preventing removal of the UOCAVA status from the change voter page but adding just a fl_UOCAVA equals "N" was not solving the issue since inserting the NULL record in absentee_UOCAVA table so added condition for if UOCAVA change flag is set to "Y" and UOCAVA_communication is not null then insert/update the change voter record in absentee_UOCAVA table (which is solving the issue).

1Issue: There is bug preventing UOCAVA status from being manually removed. There is a voter in PROD who has requested to remove UOCAVA status. This is making issuing the correct absentee ballot difficult.

Activities > Polling Place > Maintain Polling Place
)
Travis
county is needing to edit some polling locations. They go to Maintain
polling place but don’t see the location to edit. They do however see it
under
Maintain Election > Select election > assign/view poll place
.
This same issue they had back in the primary elections.
Screenshot example:

Additional issue:
Pct showing up duplicate under “Add polling place.”
Travis is reporting that when creating a new polling place under
Activities > Polling place > Add Polling place
, two pcts are showing up as duplicates. Pct 465 and Pct 466.
Additional duplicates under “ADD POLLING PLACE” drop down menu pcts
201, 204, and 271, 455
plus the ones the county reported
465 and 466.
TE - There are multiple issues in here.
There are missing polling places under the Maintain Polling Place. I think these may have been marked as Unavailable, but I can't tell from the front end.

data fix as we as code fix

County is saying
On the highlighted in yellow: clear items dated 8/5/24 and prior.
On the 2 FPCA buckets in red: clear items prior to 1/1/2024.
they still have in many of the buckets the old records they needed removed based on the dates below.
Data fix seen below.

The recently generated PDFs of registration forms for Lobbyist Employers do not include Authorization Forms for those Lobbyists that were added as part of a registration, renewal, or amendment.
Log into Lobbyist system
Work on behalf of an employer who has authorized lobbyists
Review the event log to determine which lobbyist was added by the employer on what date
View the past registrations
Expected Results:
When viewing a past registration submitted on a date when the Employer added a Lobbyist, there should be an authorization for that Lobbyist and any added by the employer prior to that date.
The date on the Authorization section should correspond to the date when that Lobbyist was added by the Employer.
Actual Results:
Authorization forms for Lobbyists are not consistently included in the registration PDF for the Employer.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Rick's email to Greg:
We have a question on the timing of adding authorization
forms to registration packets. We have two scenarios depending on who initiates
the relationship in the system. These scenarios may take place either with
established Lobbyists and Employers, or with new ones. But the assumption is
that there is no pre-existing relationship between the two. Steps 1 & 2 in
each scenario are listed simply to ensure that the two entities exist and are
visible to each other in the system. The goal here is to end up with registration
packets permanently stored for both Lobbyist and Employer that include the
Authorization form.
Scenario 1 - Start from Lobbyist side.
1 - Register Lobbyist.
1a - Registration approved.
2 - Register Employer.
2a - Registration approved.
3 - Employer adds Lobbyist to registration.
3a - Amendment approved.
4 - Lobbyist adds Employer to registration.
4a - Amendment approved.
Scenario 2 - start from Employer side.
1 - Register Employer
1a - Registration approved.
2 - Register Lobbyist
2a - Registration approved.
3 - Lobbyist adds Employer to registration.
3a - Amendment approved.
4 - Employer adds Lobbyist to registration.
4a - Amendment approved.
Question
– Should we add the Authorization Form to
the registration packet as each side’s registration adding the other party is
approved? Or do we add the Authorization Forms to
both
sides once a
fully mutual relationship is approved?
Greg's response:
Good
question. Here are my thoughts….Once an employer authorizes a lobbyist,
the authorization form can immediately be added to the employer record. The
authorization would then be added to the lobbyist only after they “form” the
relationship by adding the employer to their registration. Of course, if
the lobbyist already has the employer listed (most common scenario) then the
authorization form would be immediately added to both sides as soon as the
employer adds/amends the lobbyist on their side.

Issue: An error message is occurring during VR batch scans
Notes from AK: Below is a snap shot of the error message we get after we upload a scanned VR batch in vrems. Help please.
These sorts of errors can occur if there is network disruption, or a host of other issues.
Give us some extra details and we can see if we can’t track this down in the database.
I just tried scanning again and have been every 15 to 30 minutes since I first emailed. I am able to scan a batch of applications in VR Batch and select upload. It appears to upload the applications but then pauses for about a minute before showing the error message that I attached earlier. I have been able to scan in Barcode Batch and that works fine. We have tried on two different scanners today.
The code change reduces the size of the files when Upload is
clicked on the batch scan page. This should reduce the chance of the
application timing out and causing an error when several files are
uploaded.

Polk
County: Special/local election are not appended to annual ABBM.
Looks to be a possible scheduler issue.
Polk have 3 Special/local elections and none of them seems to be appended to a long list of annual ABBM.
The elections are:
11/05/2024--11/05/2024--CITY OF LIVINGSTON ELECTION - Districts CITY- CLV
11/05/2024--11/05/2024--LEGGETT ISD ELECTION - Districts SCHOOL- ILG
11/05/2024--11/05/2024--LIVINGSTON ISD ELECTION - Districts SCHOOL- ILV
The county processed some annual ABBMs today and it DID appended the special election automatically.
It seems to be an issue with all the annual ABBM processed before today
as I checked an annual ABBM processed on the 09/16/24 and the special election is not appended to their absentee ballot.

Update: Sequencing number repeated after the received date for the ballots was changed, voters with repeat sequence numbers were missing from the Absentee Review Board Report
New notes from AK:
I logged the absentee ballots under this menu. By mail and I Type worked fine Seq 1-6 then I had issues when I went out and changed the received date the last three by mail ballots all logged as seq. 7 . Some of the by mail (M) type didn’t have an absentee by mail application date or sent date but I logged them as an M type anyway. The seq. worked when I logged the M type who had a sent date and app date and the (M) type for those that didn’t have a sent or app date. The first Seq 7 (M) type is an example of a record that had an app and sent date for the (M) type.
The Absentee Review Board report does not show all of the voters who were logged. See attached.
Original Issue: Sequence number function not working for the REAA
We are logging REAA ballots and the by-mail ballots logged fine so far. However, when we logged our first Absentee In Person ballot to the 24REAA election it assigned the wrong sequence #. This is the same issue that happened in the Primary. Hoping we can also have this looked at as soon as possible to get the sequences assigning correctly for the REAA, as well as look at the same issue for the November election ID 24GENR before things get busy and tackle it in advance.
Under Activities > Absentee, Early and Questioned Ballots > Process Voted Absentee Ballots our staff entered the default criteria for logging the ballots for Election ID: 24REAA for REAA182. Staff proceeded to log 4 Absentee By-Mail Ballots for REAA 182 assigning sequences 1-4, which logged correctly. However, when she logged her first Absentee In Person (Type I) ballot, VREMS assigned it as Sequence 1 instead of sequence 5.
If you pull the voter back up under Activities > Absentee, Early and Questioned Ballots > Process Voted Absentee Ballots it says the voter already voted but there is no count code, ballot type or sequence number recorded under Ballot Details.
However, if we pull up that same voter under Activities > Absentee, Early and Questioned Ballots > Add/Update AV App/Ballots you can see the voter’s ballot that was logged as an I Type ballot, the REAA, Date Received, Site ID it was logged to and the Accept Code and Seq #1. Should be sequence 5.

The
county had cancelled this FPCA during the 5/28 election because the
voter came in person to vote but it keeps showing up on their report as
accepted. They did try to cancel another time but it wasn’t successful.
Monday
the county went in to the FPCA to delete the 3 accepted ballots for the
Nov 5th election but they appeared again the next day.
Yesterday
our team spoke with county to see what steps they had taken to cancel
and they did enter correctly and they again deleted the 3 accepted
ballots but they appeared again today. County also stated the residence
address on the FPCA is incorrect and should be showing Vidor TX not
Hawaii.
record removed

Henderson County reached out with a correction to their
partials
race.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY, 173RD JUDICIAL DISTRICT is not a partial for the county.
County has 30 total pcts and all 30 vote on that office

Email from Martha -
Newly registered BQC. Association to {reserve and Protect Local Livelihoods. Registered to soon. They do not need to register yet. Martha is trying to DELETE the registration and can't.
I think the issue is the status of this committee is In-Progress. To see the Delete Option, the committee needs to be Active. Looks like the Initial Report that was initially assigned on Registration, Martha has removed, this will need to be added back in and filed, order to get the committee status from In-Progress to Pending. Then The report will need to be UNFILED, and the DELETE option should now be visible.
1 Add back in the Initial Report that was removed
2 File the initial report with zero transactions. (Committee status should be updated from In-Progress to Pending)
3 Approve the Pending Registration
4 Unfile the Initial Report

Doris Poland’s treasurer contacted me to say they are showing a negative balance of $9,263.20 when they preview their 42-Day Pre-General Report. On the home page, their running balance is $4,390.24. They did file an amended 42-Day Post-Primary Report, but it was a minor change. I unfiled and refiled all of their reports, I tried doing a no change edit to one of their contributions, triggering a refiling of a report and cannot get the system to correct the ending balance for this report; I did the math and it should be $1,085.24. The report must be filed by tomorrow.
Adjusted report logic.

Annie Christy has a debt of $3,100. Payments totaling $2,100 have been entered onto this debt. Her treasurer & I have tried to amend the debt to correct the initial debt amount in order to zero out the debt, but the system will not allow that amendment with a message “Transaction amount cannot be less than the dependency amounts”. There is a $300 payment that was deleted and then re-entered. Ultimately, the system did allow me to amend the initial debt amount to $2,400, leaving a balance of $300. How do I get the system to allow me to fully zero out this balance?
Updated stored procedure to not count deleted transactions when modifying debt amounts

Notification batches are not including all recipients that they should. Those filers who are conditionally accepted and those with reports that have been started but never filed are not being included. Selection criteria for the batch needs to be updated to include those filers.

The first round of testing will be performed in QA environment.

Issue: The absentee ballots are being auto assigned sequence number 1 before being received.
When ballots are created in VR batch, batch scan, add/update ballot, they should not be assigned a sequence number until they are processed
Once they are received the voter district field is not being filled out.
Notes from AK:
SELECT a.ID_SEQUENCE,a.voter_district
FROM ABSENTEE_BALLOT a
WHERE a.ID_SEQUENCE is not null and a.ID_SEQUENCE<>''
AND ID_ELECTION=1027
and id_district='00009'
AND a.CD_REQUEST_TYPE='A'
This is a big problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible as we are logging ballots, and this could disrupt reporting and the general election process. Hopefully a sort this week on this would be good.
Balltos for Normal elections should have their sequence numbers determined by the District ID
Ballots for REAA elections should have their sequence numbers determined by the REAA district
Code change to not set sequence ID on unprocessed ballots.

The same issue that Williamson was having on Saturday when they were trying to Issue the ABBMs in the Mass ABBM Update screen is happening to at least:
Hays
Lubbock
Can you please look into this? In the case of Williamson it was an FPCA# that was not in the system and was causing the issue. I do not know if it is the same scenario for these.
Received update that for these 2 counties it is
happening for them when issuing ABBMs
,
not FPCAs
as those were done.

Provided solutions discussed with the Product team in
User Story 83134
: VM - Voter Registration Status and Reasons Comprehensive.

In the creation of new functionality for
#76401
the
first
AC was that there be
no change
for the first registration for a filer. This was to include the wording on the screen as well as the flow and location of controls. All subsequent AC referred to change to be made when renewing and filing a second and subsequent report. The point of the story was to make it clearer for filers what they needed to do.
The wording of the instructions on the screen for the filing reason has been changed for the initial registration as well and the resultant instructions made it very much less clear what the filer needs to do.

From the Public site register a new Financial Disclosure filer
Expected Results:
The Registration form should show instructions informing the filer to select a reason for filing
The Registration form should present a set of radio buttons for the reasons. This was the original functionality of the system and is the expected functionality for a new registration. (Figure 1)
Actual Results:
The registration for displays a misleading message telling the registrant to validate the reason for filing when one has not yet been added.
The registration form presents an Add Filing Reason button
The registration form does not present the radio buttons for the type of reasons for filing until after the Add Filing reason button has been clicked. (Figure 2)

The go to Ballot Return Information and enter the date and delivery method, but when they click “Update,” it prompts them to enter an address under the Ballot Issued Information tab. They enter the address and attempt to update again, but they then receive the OOPS error.
AC: Ballot can be returned without Oops Error
NOTE: THIS CAN"T BE REPRODUCED in lower environments but is an issue in PROD. Could this be a data issue with a particular voter/ballot?

Williamson Ballot Styles Issue
When
Williamson generated their ballot styles for the final time they had 73
Ballot Styles starting with BS2 and ending with BS77. This remained the
case when they generated the Ballot Styles and ran the Ballot Style
Report on 9/18/24.
When
they ran the Ballot Styles Report today, there are still 73 Ballot
Styles, and they still start with BS2, but now it ends with BS78.
There is one difference they can find;
BS11
(which was on their 9/10/24 and 9/18/24 Ballot Styles Reports) is no
longer on the 9/24/24 Ballot Styles Report, and there is a new ballot
style, BS78, which is identical to the missing BS11, including being in
the exact same voting precinct.
County requesting that
BS78 become BS11 again
,
and need this to happen without any other Ballot Styles or Precincts
getting changed since we have already begun mailing Ballots.
I
have attached the Ballot Style Reports from 9/10/24 and 9/24/24, as
well as screen captures of BS11 from the 9/10/24 report and BS78 from
the 9/24/24 report.

As an SVRS user
I want to be register new voters without them having unexplained previous names and addresses
Issue: In some cases, when the user reviews an OVR record and clicks New Voter, the Previous Name and Previous Address fields are populated. This is a New Voter, they shouldn't have any previous name or address.

We have multiple issues for the duplicate voter participation flow that need to be addressed.
Pop up text needs to change when warning users of possible duplicate participation record, when inputting duplicate records manually through single/multiple voter participation.
"Inserted election history details for voter registration number(s).
Some of the voter election participation history might be duplicates. Please review the records in the voter participation duplicate dashboard."
When manually adding in single/multiple duplicate voter participation records and selecting "Not duplicate" button in the possible voter participation duplicate bucket's compare screen, we are getting a message saying that the record has been successfully "rejected" when it should say "Accepted" like the screenshot below
Currently there is an issue with reports not processing in UAT
The Possible voter participation duplicate reports when pulled for other "Election date - names" is reverting back to the old language instead of the newly revised ones. The current uploaded duplicate files reports show the newly revised ones, but any other Election date - names selected use the old language.

Multiple counties (Cass, Caldwell, Hunt) have reported the Voter
History report and Single Voter Participation screen are showing two
records for voters but only one record on the ABBM screen. Can y’all
look into why this is happening?
We have had the issue in the
past where if one record is deleted in Single Voter Participation (SVP)
then both get deleted. Need to be sure if that is the only way to
resolve that both do not get deleted.
Example: Cass (VUID: 2214496656)
ABBM screen: 1 record.
SVP screen: 2 records. Only difference in the records is Envelope tracking ID.

Local party committee the “Democrats of Kennebunk, Kennebunkport, and Arundel” filed their 2024 July Semiannual report yesterday. It is late, but never appeared on the Admin Task page. The only report that showed up was a late 24 hour report. Why didn’t the July report, which is also late show up here? I ask because there could be other local party committees whose reports could be filed and we wouldn’t know it. The reports are subject to penalties, so this is important.

Expected Results:
Upon approval, all registrations are approved without error message as shown above.
The issue occurs when a lobbyist is in conditional status and is then renewed into a new cycle, thus leaving the previous version of that member in conditional status while the new version is not. The previous member version which was conditional was showing up in the conditional registrations list for admins. Trying to approve anything other than the current version of a member leaves the system unable to join Person info and the like thus throwing index out of bounds exception.
The fix will only show current versions of members in the conditional registrations screen and checks the size of lobbyistassociates array in the off chance no persons for the lobbyist exist to send emails to.

County needs to print mail labels but
there is an issue happening with Absentee Screen. County is very
worried about sending out hundreds of mailing labels without barcodes as
they can’t print the ones that teams generates.
Problem:
TEAM
is dropping the state from the address box in the Search Absentee
screen. Other times it is putting the address in twice under street
name/PO Box. It moves the street name to the that field then duplicates
in Address Line 2.
It is dropping before they hit the
UPDATE button. Some voters when they click on the ADD button, the state
name is there with the residence address, while others have no state
name. Then when they put the state in and they move on to another field
it disappears.

ABBM Voting History rejections for Rockwall County
Rockwall county ISSUE reported by VOTEC:
Rockwall
County is getting rejections when trying to submit voting history for
two of their ABBM voters and I've researched the issue but don't see why
the records are being rejected or what we should do to resolve them.
The error message received when submitting the AR/AA transactions for
both voters is "...envelope number " ", on "11-05-2024" was already
posted by "AC" record".
Big picture is that both voters were
previously registered in Hunt County before moving to Rockwall and the
ballot tracker shows that they did submit ABBM applications for the
November Election in January 2024 from Hunt, but the status of the
January 2024 applications is now CANCELLED in the ballot tracker.
Since
we have never sent an "AC" record for either voter from Rockwall County
my guess is that the Hunt application was cancelled with an "AC" code
and somehow this is the AC code referenced in the error message that is
preventing the AR/AA transactions from Rockwall from going through.
The voters with the rejected transactions are:
1002031567 - GIBSON, WALTER TOMMY JOE
AR/AA transactions sent to TEAM in file: 199_20240923BLT_ACTIVITY1.TXT - Reference No: 1158471
1002031514 - CHRISTIAN, ROBERT
AR/AA transactions sent to TEAM in file: 199_20240925BLT_ACTIVITY1.TXT - Reference No: 1160020
So
I'm hoping someone can take a look and see if the AC cancellation for
the applications from Hunt County are impacting the ability to send a
new application from Rockwall County, and if so how we can get this
resolved.
See the query above.

data fix

Issue:
Okay, I’m fairly certain then that they pushed the “fix” into production. When logging absentee ballots this morning, specifically online delivery ballots, when they are scheduling it and enter the email address into the field it will not let them save the record. It says it is an invalid email address. This is problematic enough I would maybe recommend that if possible they roll back last night’s fix.
It is occurring in Add/Update and VR Batch. It is not occurring in OABA as long as the voter has not already had a ballot for another election scheduled this year because it auto populates the absentee line. If you have to manually add the line it throws the same errors below.
Also, the email issue is coming up too in the interested election worker area of the registration portion. It won’t let you move on if there is an email in that field either.
Add/Update:
VR Batch:
Code change to fix email regex in javascript validation library.

Production issue (can be replicated in migration)

Production issue:
Attempting to file an Application for Reinstatement for entity number: 11267420-0142
The code should allow a reinstatement if the entity was Administratively Dissolved within the last 5 years. This entity is in a status of Inactive/Administratively dissolved just like it needs to be. But I don't know if what we have in the db is showing within the last 5 years or not. The errors are saying 1. It's not dissolved (which you can see in the screenshot it is), and 2. It wasn't dissolved in the last 5 years (which you can see in the screenshot it definitely was)
I'm trying to figure out if the date we have in the database that it's looking at is wrong, or if something is wrong with how the status is currently saved, or if the code is wrong. It's one of those 3, I just don't know which.

2 primary issues with this, I believe:
Same reservation code seems to be being used for multiple names, causing problems when people try to use the code they were sent (they can't choose which name they're wanting when multiple pull up on the name availability tab)
I believe we may be having an issue where these might for some reason be creating two rows in the db, and two different name reservation codes may be getting generated for each name (this might be wrong, because it's been a while since we talked about it, but I think that was an issue. If I'm wrong, let me know, and I'll delete this note!
1. Name Reservation (Wild Rock Excavation 14501895) was created on 9/19/24. I can see the details in Filing History, but when I go to Correspondence History for this entity, it's blank, so I can't see what was emailed to him. But he's attempting to use the reservation code he received and it's not working.
Entity Information:
Filing History:
Correspondence History:
Error when attempting to use Release Code
2. Additional issue:
The name reservation was for an internal review item for "better networks" (work order number W2024100338413). When I went in to process the work order, the name disappeared. I approved it and it appeared to process, however, the approved name reservation is not showing up (no entity was created).
3. DBA registration inhouse when customer reserves name online
This Name Reservation code pulled up two names when entering the release code in. Name was for Simple Touch Nails by Monica (business name reservation #14502811). After approving a DBA with a Name Reservation code entered, the acknowledgement and file stamp refers to entity #14187830, which cannot be found in the system. I have attached a copy of the approved filing documentation. (Cherie's note: I have asked Mandeep to add the entity number to this entity - but we need to make sure to fix the problem... if a reservation ID is entered in the Name Availability step, they should be able to select the correct one, and the DBA created should also save the entity ID+UTC number in the system).
After discussion with Mandeep, we identified that the stamped file copy is pulling the number from the BusinessId field for these instead of from the EntityNumber field, and it's not saving to the EntityNumber field, only the the EntityNumberWithUTC field (it's possible this is being caused from force approving these work orders?).

Under Financial Reports - Go to close our an Individual Batch Proof Report, grid only shows 30 items so additional items display on page 2. When clicking to page 2, the system just spins and does not load. Either fix the pagination or allow more items to be displayed in the grid without pagination.

This work order (W2024092312525) was rejected, resubmitted, and then approved, but no entity number was generated.
These all have the same issue:

W2024091604894: Blue Mountain Contractors LLC
W2024102484813: Mountain View Rentals Ogden

The internal review from the Online system to the In-house was transferred incorrectly. The customer on the in-house system submitted the Name as "SG P&B LLC", when the customer called we tried to look for it in the Work Order Queue it came up as "SG P". Work Order # W2024092009388-001

Attempted to reject work order W2024091604779
for name conflict - put rejection reason in Comments and selected Business Registration in the correspondence box selection but it then gave this error after clicking Reject. Redid it and gave the same error.
It's been determined that this was caused due to special characters in the comments box. We need to fix that, either by allowing those characters, or by giving a pop-up error message telling the user why it can't go through
This error also populates when they paste information (it doesn't automatically paste as plain text) - we should see what can be done to fix that, too.
We know for sure # % and $ cause issues. Quotation mark also causes the field on the rejection letter to display code instead of whatever's been entered in the comments. (The comment entered here said: The name submitted is missing an appropriate ending such as "limited liability company" or "limited company" or the abbreviation
"L.L.C.", "LLC", "L.C.", or "LC". "Limited" may be abbreviated as "Ltd.", and "company" may be
abbreviated as "Co.".) - as you can see, everything after the quotation mark got cut out, and code was inserted instead. I replicated this in the QA environment.

Any employer who ever authorized the Lobbyist in the past should show as authorized in the present if added to the registration by the Lobbyist.
Actual Results
Employers show as authorized only if both Employer and Lobbyists added each other to their respective registrations in the current year.
Added logic to handle employers that only registered lobbyists in previous years.

"Professional" by itself is a distinguishable word. But when used in combination with "Corporation" for a "Professional Corporation", it doesn't make a name distinguishable.
This corporation exists in QA: "CHERIE 092624 BUSINESS CORP" (

"Cherie 092624 business professional corporation" should not be distinguishable, but it's not showing any conflict.

Quarter report showing in the filing schedule, but the transaction that it is pointing to looks exactly the same as the original filing.
Do you mind looking at this?
The amended transaction has essentially the same data as the original transaction. The system does not show who updated the transaction, but it was last updated on 1/4/2024.

The Jefferson County Republican Executive Committee filed a Major Contribution Report, but it shows $0. Our system pulled the late report and shows that the monetary amount for the penalty to be $0. This can be unusual for a Major Contribution Report because that type of report is trigged by a contribution in the amount of $20,000.00 or more.
Is there PAC reporting activity that may be missing or would have triggered the report that we’re not seeing?

Someone added a transaction that triggered the MC Report. If that transaction is later updated, or deleted, the MC Report does not disappear. They can either file it with $0.0 or remove the report. If the committee has already filed the report, then need to unfile it before they delete it. Closing this ticket

This was fixed via data fix and audit history was asked to be removed which is why audit history is not shown. The voter show in WIRT but should be showing in Jefferson. The address on the voter is correct but they are showing the wrong county for some reason.

There is a voter who appears on the UI in Wirt County, but has a Jefferson County address and precinct. 100557137.
She does not appear on neither Wirt or Jefferson’s alpha list. She does not appear in Jefferson’s pollbooks. I cannot determine if she appears in Wirt’s pollbooks since there is not a precinct 21B in Wirt. Based on her audit history, she has never been registered in Wirt
the last change audit date for 100557137 appears to be 4/21/2022 by Jefferson user 019KCARDEN. I checked voter files saved from 3/28/2022 and 4/25/2022 and the voter was in Jefferson in both files. Unless I am missing something, the change to Wirt does not appear to be related to a Jefferson or Wirt county user change.
In the 9/13/2024 voter file 100557137 is in Jefferson, and in the 9/14/2024 voter file 100557137 is in Wirt.

This Domestic Corporation Sole is showing a Renew By Date of 01/01/0001 - for Corporation Sole, it should be displaying N/A instead
Fixed the code

This is the issue that has been identified related to merged or converted records that we need to figure out how to correct. Below is an example provided from the client.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Email from attorney: Can you please tell me how to obtain the record of the above referenced entity (which I now understand is a DBA) when it was originally incorporated as a corporation sole in 1916 in Utah? Besides the dba, I do not find it anywhere by searching for its name, or something similar, on your site.
The DBA (
11371958-0151
) was formed in 2019 and has the application image. Mike looked it up and the parent organization is
553976-0145
. When you look up that entity number and then the filing history, only the 10 most recent images appear. There should be over 200 images going back to 1916.

11034091-0160

7166141-0160
I believe this is related to the formation filing being a conversion instead of formation

This is a Foreign Limited Partnership, and it was formed through a Foreign Registration Statement, so it's unrelated to not having a formation document on the record. Other Foreign Limited Partnerships are not throwing this error. It's doing the same thing in migration.
This is a duplicate of 83311. Closing this one out so we don't do double work.

Users who register and select registration fee exemption have a problem where their payment for training disappears after made through the CC portal.
Update 10/7 - see discussion, we are seeing more people who are seeing the training fee disappear.
Register a lobbyist and mark that they are exempt from registration fee.
Complete and sign in as the user
Go pay your training fee as the lobbyist (CC).
Note it disappears once you pay it, and the link to training website also doesn't trigger as a result
Expected results - Paying training fee doesn't disappear when you pay it for ANY users
Actual - The training fee is disappearing when you pay it for registration exempt filers.
MemberVersionId was not being inserted on Fee record for training fees, thus could not join to registration when creating FeePenaltyPayment record. Any fees paid where there were no others to join to registration will be missing this FeePenaltyPayment record in db. Fix correctly inserts MemberVersionId on Fee record for training fees and issue will no longer occur.

Expected functionality: The filing image should not have the rejection letter attached to it
Additional note: This can't be fixed in office correct. If you go in there, delete out the existing image, and upload a new one - then when you look online and open the filing image, it's just the new image with the same rejection letter attached.
**Once we fix this issue, we also need to find all of the filings that are showing up like this, and remove that rejection letter, so that they're only actually displaying the stamped file copy in the filing history.-+**

Email from Dave Hunter
A committee, PAUL STROMMEN FOR LEGISLATURE (ID: 24CAC10566) has several Unpaid bills displaying negative balances. They have not made any payments so it doesn’t make any sense as to what is going on.
Their Treasurer was freaking out but I told him it was ok to go ahead and file and we will get it fixed.
The problem was a bug in the function that calculates the balance of unpaid bills for the Expenditure Work Page. (Specifically, there was an extraneous condition in the calculation of total unpaid bill forgiveness that caused it to sometimes include forgiveness records from other committees' unpaid bills). The issue has been fixed and hotfixed to Production and all other environments.

Expected functionality: Effective Date on the stamped file copy, and on the entity information should be the date it was submitted (effective date should = payment date, not approval date - unless they entered a future effective date). If they enter a future effective date, that's already working as expected - the effective date should be that future effective date.

The committee transferred $5392.42 on the 2022 2nd quarter report. The reports are correct until you get to the 2023 2nd quarter report. It looks like the transfer of excess funds is showing again. I thought maybe there was two transactions under contributions, but I can only see one.
The reports have been regenerated in Production.
I have updated the transaction that was showing in the Immediate To Do List as unfiled when it really was filed. Now that report is no longer showing as needing amending in the Immediate To Do List. The script used is:
Update Transactions
Set TransactionMode = 'F',
FiledDate = '2024-10-08'
Where TransactionID = 375317
And TransactionVersionID = 1

When a user performs a search for a precinct, the parent node in the tree structure is displayed correctly. However, the corresponding child nodes within the tree structure are not being retrieved or displayed. This issue may lead to confusion, as users expect to see the full hierarchy of precincts.
Below issue is observed in multiple screens.
Issue1:
Navigate to EM->Polling places->Actions->View->Precinct assignment
Search for a precinct by name
Expected Result: The parent node should be visible, along with all relevant child nodes under it in the tree structure.
Actual Result: Only the parent node is displayed, and the child nodes are missing.
Note: This behavior is not occurring with the child under the first parent node; I can successfully search the child within first node.

Request from Lisa Blake.
All the Circuit Court Judicial Candidates (Except for those in the 14th Circuit) and all the Family Court Judges, that have a General Report on their filing schedule, need it removed.
Then the begin date of the 2024 4th Quarter report needs to be updated to October 1, 2024.
So the dates on the 2024 4th Qtr report will be 10/1/24 - 12/31/24.
Can we update all the candidates for her since there are so many?
If not, can we get her a list of all the ones that need to be updated? All Candidates for the office of Circuit Court Judge with the Circuit Listed, as well as all the Family Court Judges, that are ACTIVE.
Thanks
This request has been completed. The script used is attached.

This committee came into the office today and the ending balance is negative 62,607.26. Can you please look at the 2019 2
nd
Quarter Report and zero the year-to-date totals? Will that year-to-date total correct the balance throughout the rest of the reports?
The committee says they have $72,503.00 in their account and do not want to continue to file with a negative balance when that is not the correct amount.
An expenditure was being left off of the 2022 1st Quarter Report because it was missing the payee. I have updated the Expenditure schedule of the report to include such expenditures (which will display with a blank payee). All reports starting with 2022 1st Quarter Report have been regenerated.
The beginning values have been set as requested and the reports regenerated. The script used is:

Issue: WV requests a one time report that contains
demographic data
AC:
Report will contain voters that are:
1. Cancelled voters only
2. Aged 60-80
3. Include DOB
4, Include address
5. Include instances of voter history
6. Include status reason (deceased, no activity, moved out... etc.)
Report attached

Issue:
Please see the attached spreadsheet.
This contains a list of voters who had a change of county, but not a change of address. In this case, voters are showing in Berkeley County with an address in Morgan County. These voters were all last updated by the CIVIX team during a 4/19/24 data fix.
AC:
investigate how voters had unexpected county applied
if moved as a result of a previous data fix, move all listed voters back to Morgan county
VOTER & VOTER DISTRICTS table are updated.

Steps to Reproduce:
Navigate to the ENR STATUS search feature.
Enter a query for ENR STATUS.
Observe the displayed results, particularly the alignment of values under the headings.
Expected Result:
The values should be centered directly below their respective headings.
Actual Result:
The values are aligned to the left of the headings.
There is not a programmatic way to tell if a table header is currently wrapping to adjust the content to center underneath. Solution is to add a new class to override the text-align of the header to always be left justified. When header wraps it will still stick to left side instead of centering itself.

Issue: Address discrepancies reported by WV
Note: These may be addresses that were updated by a user AFTER submitting. That would explain.
AC:
Investigate these changes to see if there is some other data issue
Description from WV:
Logan County voter 000382283 is registered at 1183 Dog Fork Rd in Chapmanville, and they appear in the alpha list. However, when searching the street, Dog Fork Rd does not exist. I even checked Street Information for voters on other streets with “Dog” in the name with no luck of finding the voter.
The same with Beechwood Rd. in Chapmanville. Logan voter 100047732 is registered there, but the street does not appear when searching under Street Information.
And again with Lee Miller Rd in Chapmanville. Voters 100786450, 100685897, & 100793972.
Lastly – Hubert Hill Rd in Chapmanville for voter 100709716. This road is in both Chapmanville and Accoville. When searching the street, there is not an option for the Chapmanville one. But the voter does indeed appear on the alpha list.

Counties so far reported : Dallas, Fort Bend, Montgomery
Issue
: Voting History Import is not updating statuses or it is getting flagged by the Possible Duplicate voter participation. Counties are uploading the voting history import and get back a noreply email confirming the process of the file. All process successfully. It fails none.
Dallas and Fort Bend are experiencing the same thing but I will be using Montgomery for the main example.
Montgomery uploaded the voting history import into TEAMS GEN110524.2024.10.07_Def_Carrier.ASC
They received back a no reply email confirming that the file processes successfully.
The county kept on uploading as usual thinking it was going through TEAMS. They then noticed the large increase of Possible Voter Participation Duplicates. And the voters they updated on Monday are appearing there.
This is an example of what is being shown: We think that TEAMS is reading the code “BM” as ballot being mailed again on a future date when in reality the county has already mailed it and what they are trying to update is received date.
On Search Absentee Screen is showing as Mailed ballot on 9/25. The county did the upload to change the status as received on 10/7. It just didn’t do it.
Below is an explanation from Montgomery:
"BM beside the AB might be causing an issue.
You can see an example below in Image 1.
The TEAM Voter History File Layouts require a Vote Method in column 678 and a Voting History Type Code in column 684.
These are required fields. We just wanted to clarify that we haven’t change our programming on this for many years. I hope this helps."
*All counties especially Fort Bend is concerned because some of their application needed to be rejected and available for voters to cure but its not appending the elections with the uploads.

Description:
When a user selects "View Voter Information" after scrolling to the bottom of the voter list, they are redirected to the middle of the View Voter Info page instead of the top. This behavior disrupts user experience as it requires additional scrolling to access the relevant information.
Steps to Reproduce:
Search for a voter in the system.
Scroll down to the bottom of the list.
Click on "View Voter Information."
Observe where the page loads.
Expected Result:
The user should be taken to the top of the View Voter Information page for easy access to all content.
Actual Result:
The user is taken to the middle of the page, necessitating further scrolling.
Added an id to our breadcrumb component, using the id and the existing header.component.ts router.events navigationEnd logic, when a page uses router.navigate to navigate and the navigation is completed successfully a method is triggered that scrolls the breadcrumb component into view instantly, forcing the newly loaded component to start at the top of the page. This issue does not exist when routing with window.location.href as window.location.href is hard reloading the page at the newly given URL.

It looks like there’s file
corruption beginning around the mailing address columns of the rows of voter
data. In these further right-side columns, the info randomly breaks off
in the middle of nowhere, with weird spacing and line breaks that are not like
our previous voter files
Also, for the 5 extracts that
were for regular statewide VR requests, all of those pulls have file sizes that
look off to me. The file sizes are about 1/6 smaller than usual, even
though the count of voter extracts slowly goes up over time. Usually, I’d
say the file size of a VR file is above 1,250,000 KB up to 1,500,000 KB, but
the files pulled this week are all like 1,000,000 KB.
The file size shrinking could
be partly explained by the issue described above, of some of the columns of
voter data being cut short/cut off.
The voter files pulled
earlier this month (on 10/2) and further back all look fine and don’t have the
problem. The issue seems to be in voter files pulled (using the PIR
module) from 10/8 going forward

Need verification of email notification schedules for Filing Reminder emails and Late Filing Reminders.
Here is what the ADM FE29 Correspondence for Candidate and Committees WV Documentation has.
Upcoming Report Due Reminder
2
days before the due date for reports that are not filed yet, Civix automatically sends an email reminder to those that have not filed.
Notice of Unfiled Report
1 day after the report was due, Civix sends the Notice of Unfiled Report email overnight.
Late Filing reminders
5 days after the report was due, Civix sends late filing reminders for reports that are not yet filed.
WV has only two types of notifications, not three types as the documentation shows.
The filing due reminders are sent out 2 days before the due date for reports that are not yet filed. (They used to also go out 7 days before the due date, but they asked us to turn those off and we did).
Late filing reminders are sent out 5 days after the due date for reports that are not yet filed.

No code changes required Thomas will test it If still an issue will work on this

This one is coming back and/or new MVP bugs being opened for it. Not working in UAT as anticipated. Three main issues with some smaller ones as well:
Biggest issue is that while reports from the old cycle are being removed, those from the new cycle are not being added. This is based on a 2026 Election and Cycle added to UAT.
The Run for Office button is only supposed to appear if the current date is between the registration period begin and registration period end dates for a given Election Cycle. Seems to be showing up based on the current date being between the Cycle Begin and Cycle End dates.
Requirement/AC miss - should have specified that the election dropdown should only include FUTURE elections. Evidently, we don't in fact have a time machine.
Minor issue - Mail-in/Walk-in radio buttons should be enabled and required if working on behalf.
Minor issue - Specified label for Amendment Date when working on behalf is not correct
Minor issue - Amendment date should default to current date, seems to be populated with original registration date.
NOTE - this was tested in UAT for the current Governor (
Michelle Lujan Grisham, ID 1453
) and SOS (Maggie Toulouse Oliver, ID 1471) and they were updated for the 2026 General Election

A registration form will be added noting the selected election
any existing, non-election related, unfiled reports with due dates in the future should be removed
new reports from the Candidate Election Cycle linked to the selected Election should be added to the reporting schedule

Several counties with this,
below is just 1 example.

envelope # is different. This is showing as a duplicate.

System was pulling in the FPCA VUID instead of the regular one. We will log a separate bug to fix that.

Adding a political contribution supporting a candidate who is not registered in the system causes the On Behalf Of field to stop working in subsequent iterations of data entry for that report. Must close dialog and re-open it to be able to use that field correctly again.
Also inactive candidates should be part of the search for candidates being supported by a contribution

Absentee Ballot not Appearing - GALVESTON & POTTER
County:
Galveston & Potter
Issue
: FPCA not appending to voter even though the county has tried multiple times throughout the week and last week. The November ballot appends when they click Accept and then the following day it clears off. We had a similar issue where the FPCA was not appending and was fixed. This is appending but then the next day it is no longer there. Both are reverting back the following day after it looks good. Need to be sure once appended record is not removed.
Galveston:
Vuid: 2187946787/FPCA Vuid: 2216327144
- Server 2.126 A. Attempted on 10/8/2024 and 10/9/2024.
Potter:
VUID 2149035661/FPCA Vuid 2216190377
· 1st time they processed the FPCA was on Monday, October 7th . The server on Wednesday when they try to append again the election was 2.126 B , on October 9th around 2.40pm, And now they are on the server 2.147C
I think while doing voter import process we are inserting one record into absentee_ballot table for fpca voter, on that time we are not inserting voter id, how I am saying based on user id like 'VOTERIMPORT' ,
we need to do more investigation on this one in future

This is an issue both online and inhouse
Log in inhouse (or online)
Create a filing
Once you get into processing the work order, reject it
Come back to the work order and find it in your Internal Rejected queue - hit the arrow to return it to processing queue
Go back to the main queue and find the work order again, but this time approve it
Current functionality: Rejection letter is still getting sent out (stamped file copy does show up in entity filing history, but the rejection is emailed out instead of the approval documents)
Expected functionality: Now that it's been approved, rejection should not be there, but the approval documents should be sent (Acknowledgement, Receipt and Stamped File Copy)
This was fixed in user story 81569, but right now they have to wait overnight to be able to approve it. This bug will be to correct whatever is causing that caching issue, so that they can approve it as soon as the corrected documents have been submitted, without having to be concerned about when it was rejected
This is what got sent when I did the same filing, but it never got rejected (so it's not an issue of them not being mapped...):
Added configurable web.config value to ignore specified LookupData keys

While assisting Louis with some information on the BIPS/Datalyzer/ExternalInterface application/service, I discovered an abnormality with the ExternalInterface log files.
Beginning on 9/5, the log files jumped up substantially in size. At the same time a new error pops up (the first occurrence is found near the end of the 9/4 log (see below)). I did a spot check of other log dates pre-9/4, but did not see the error. I attached the 9/3 and 9/4 logs for comparison. Can you please forward to the dev team for their review and action (if necessary)? Thanks.
Fixed duplicate batch process in External Interface service to handle voter names with apostrophes.

VRU file from 10/08/2024
File: 101_20241008VOTER2.TXT.1168729
This is your reference number: 01168729

Issue: County is worried that the vru exports they received are incomplete. County sent a large voter export last night, and based on the imports that they received today it does not match the amount they sent yesterday. The export yesterday was over 2,000 but today when county did the imports, it was 2 files of less than 100…
Are you able to confirm that the vru exports are complete?

ssue
: Medina county - When going to delete a duplicate record in search absentee, the county is able to successfully delete it. However, the next day the record reappears. The county as well as our internal team has tested this several times, and each time the record returns. Additionally, there is a “triplicate” record, and the same rebounding issue occurs when trying to delete. Closely related to the Multiple Counties - Duplicate Voter History ticket we have open.
This is the duplicate record that continues to rebound back.
VUID: 2146403066 (only showing once on SVP screen)
This is the triplicate record: there are only two right now, as Medina was able to successfully delete one today (1:56pm). This record has always rebounded back.
VUID: 1205880288 (duplicate records on SVP screen with different envelope IDs)
we did data fix for this ticket issue right now, we have to investigation on this more.

Can you figure out why their report is acting up?
Report shows a different $ Amount on on Schedule B-IE-1 Candidate(s) Supported/Opposed than on Schedule B-IE-2 Expenditures. Totals on both Schedule B's are to match.
Schedule B-IE-2 is missing two expenditures. That are getting picked up on B-IE-1.
Both of the Ind Expenditures are missing the Payee, (Erickson Communications Group, Inc). When you click to Edit both of the Expenditures, you receive an error.
The Expenditures are:
10/11/2024
-
To Erikson Communications Group, Inc for 1,578.00 for
PRO
Professional services (graphic design, legal services, web design, etc.) $1,578.00 in SUPPORT of Hon. Glenn Chip Curry Senator Dist 6.
10/11/2024 - To Erikson Communications Group, Inc for $4,731.50 for
PRO
Professional services (graphic design, legal services, web design, etc.) Broken down by $2,365.75 in SUPPORT of Michael Tipping Senator Dist 8 and $2,365.75 to OPPOSE Mr Leo Christopher Kenney Senator Dist 8.
Looks like Schedule B-IE-1 is picking up the Expenditures that are missing the Payees, but Schedule B-IE-2 is not.
There are two Payees in the Contributor/Payee Table, both for Erickson Communications Group, Inc. One is in all caps, the other is in upper/lower case. Not sure what that would have to do with it, but I did notice it.

Report shows filed
Date 10/3/2024 11:07 AM
None of these transactions are now showing as filed in the database.
Unfortunately, the Event Log does not track report Unfilings.
It does show logins, and it looks like Kelly logged in after the report was filed. Have you checked with her?
Hopefully she UNFILED the report for them for whatever reason or even by mistake.
The only thing to do at this point is to check the report in with the original file date, then have the committee file it again.
We will keep our eye open for other reports that show up as needing to be filed, that were already filed, but I don’t think we are going to find anything.
Kelly V emailed that she had indeed unfiled the report.
Committee must not have ever re-filed it.

County entered by mail applications/FPCAs but they are not appearing in the abbm module but they appear in the FPCA/ABBM Report.
We did data fix for this ticket issue, we need to do more investigation on this one in future

Abbey Deleted a transaction from 2004 today, not sure why?
Can we now Undelete the delete?
Email from Committee to Abbey - Working on the state party’s Pre-Election report and Line 18
Column B is off by $397. I searched the database for a disbursement of that
amount and found one from LexisNexis (a vendor we haven’t used two decades)
dated for 9/20/2024. When I hit the show details screen, it says this is filed.
I have no idea where this came from. Are you able to delete
it? I tried to delete it but am getting the “a negative offset record will be
added” message. Attaching a pic of it to this email.
The expenditure has been updated and the offset has been removed. The script used is:
Update STCF1_FiledExpenditures
Set ExpenditureDate = '2004-09-20'
Where ExpenditureID = 200841
Update Expenditure
Set ExpenditureDate = '2004-09-20',
Amended = '0'
Where ExpenditureID = 200841
Delete Expenditure
Where ExpenditureID = 960975

The state is reporting that the Unexpected Error is popping up when attempting to create a new voter or cancelling a voter.
Medina county is reporting it on Firefox, 2.126C
When they process a Voter Application and clicks on Accept that is when they are getting the error message.
I just tried cancelling a Test voter I entered in Anderson county and when I selected cancel under Voter Tasks I got the “Unexpected Error”.
Chrome, 2.147B
I see the Notice of Cancellation generated but when I look up the Test voter it is still in Active status.
So the system IS NOT cancelling the voter but it is generating the Letter.
Added new Oracle data files.

Current functionality: The UTC -0163 (domestic series LLC UTC) is being added to the entity number
Expected functionality: The UTC number that applies to the selected classification should be added to the entity number
(This at least applies to domestic llcs and business corps. I did not try other entity types)
(For d-corps, it's currently adding
0142 regardless of selected classification)

Environments: Prod, UAT
Discription:
Some principals have reported that they don't see the action menu in their lobbyist grid, preventing them from authorizing lobbyist relationships.
I am unable to repro this issue, but the client has reported receiving many calls.
Update JG 10/24 - This issue is an issue when a filer renews, so as part of testing you will need to run a renew scenario.
Working As:
User:
robin@barretogroup.com
Password: Test1234
Work as a principal who has pending lobbyist authorizations
Go to the Lobbyist grid
Note the action menu is missing
Expected - Action menu should always display in the lobbyist grid for pending relationships
Actual - Action menu is missing for some principals, such as IDs 11802 and 10886 in production.
UPDATE 10/18
More users in prod w the issue - 13109
The home screen link to authorize is also missing the selection.
Fixed principal renewal login issues and demoed the change in DEV on 10/24/2024

Report has not been filed, and on PREVIEW it is showing the transaction plus the offset. Why is it showing that?
Page 14, showing a Contribution offset from Lois Reiner, on 4/13/2024 for ($100.00).
The original is on this report as well as an offset?
Deleted contributions in UAT - Are not showing up on the PREVIEW, as long as the original transaction has not yet been filed.
What happened in this case is that the original transaction was created, the report was filed, and then the transaction was deleted, causing the offset to be created. Then the report was unfiled. (As far as I can tell, the reports include all offsets that are filed; however, in most cases, there would be no offset during the same reporting period because the transaction would be deleted completely instead of an offset being created).
If they want us to remove the offset and the original transaction, we can do so as long as the report has not been filed.

When a Lobbyist amends their registration, adds a registered Employer, and indicates that the Lobbyist will pay the registration fee, both parties are getting the registration fee added as outstanding.

If an employer starts an Unscheduled Report but does not file it, the report is only listed on the Pending tab of the reports page and not also on the Unfiled tab. This differs from the behavior of a schedule report if started and not filed, which shows on both tabs - Unfiled and Pending. This leads to filers being noted as out of compliance and there is no means of deleting the report from the Pending tab. Delete only exists on the Unfiled tab.

FEEDBACK FROM COUNTY:
I have discovered an anomaly in the absentee records in TEAM.
We
had a few voters we were trying to get their applications cured. In
our system and what we submitted was an Application Reject with a Reason
of IC No Outside County Address Online Cure Available.
When I
look them up in TEAM the main screen shows a status of Received under
Application Status and therefore will not pull up in the Ballot Tracker.
But when you click Update and open the record, the Application Reject Reason is correct.
So I selected the check box for Application Rejected and left the reason that was showing and clicked Update.
The main screen shows a correct Application Status of Rejected and they now show in the Ballot Tracker.
Hopefully this will help the techs in figuring out the issue.
See PR.

The Assumed Name (DBA) formation online was allowing non DBA entity numbers to be entered into the Renewal ID tab
When that happened, the system was adding a Certificate of Assumed and of True Name to the entity entered in the Renewal ID tab, which it should not have done
On the renewal ID tab (for DBA renewal inhouse, for General Partnerships inhouse and online, for Business Trusts online) - we need to ensure they can only select an entity that matches the selected entity type.
Then we need to find any non Assumed Name (DBA) entities that have a Certificate of Assumed and of True Name that was created in our system

**I attached two emails with information regarding specific authorization codes that are not working.**
When Authorization codes are entered/validated, the entities show up under "File on an Existing Business", but do NOT show up under My Entities. I'm wondering if that's what's actually causing the confusion for people...?
The above screenshot shows the 23 entities that show up when I click File on an Existing Business (I just sent myself filing authority on 10 migrated entities), but the below screenshot shows only 13 entities under "My Entities" - something should be updated in the My Entities section to pull all of the entities that I have filing authority on, not just the ones I created.

URGENT Duplicate Voting History - MONTGOMERY County
Montgomery county
is getting frustrated.
From:
Lay, Jason
You will see by my research below I take the possibility of duplicate voter history seriously.
This has taken quite a bit of my valuable time and pulled me from my other responsibilities.
You
will find below there are a couple of records that the Return Type of
ERTN wasn’t applied in our file upload. This is due to the file import
issues experienced in TEAM not so long ago.
A few records shown below are not duplicates they were canceled in another county.
Yet others have a single record in Absentee Search but shows two rows for the same Envelope ID.
If
there is more information that you need, let me know. I will be
getting Estela to resubmit the ERTN records to clean up those two.
Absentee Search

In Absentee Ballot Search you can see there is only one record/envelope id.
But in Single Voter Participation there are two rows showing identical data for the same envelope id.

Environment: Texas QA
Navigate to
EM->Polling Places->Actions->Precinct Assignment Screen->ADD/MAINTAIN

Expected Result: 1.System must display the "PRE_LOCAL" precinct in the search results, P

2.When a User navigates to the Assign Polling Place Precincts Screen ,The nodes in the system are currently in a collapsed state and need to be updated to an expanded view.
Actual Result:
System displays the parent node "MUNICIPAL/LOCAL" in the search results and the actual precinct is shown when User expands the node

In Miami Dade, the principal workspace lobbyist grid is displaying the wrong Auth date for some lobbyist. It seems it is pulling the most recent auth date (or potentially the most recent amendment date) from the lobbyist rather than the authorized date for the lobbyist-principal relationship.
Create a lobbyist and an associated principal, with an authorized date of 8/13/24 for example.
Work as the lobbyist and go create additional principal relationships with authorized dates beyond the one created in step 1.
Go and work as the principal. Notice that the authorized date for the lobbyist-principal relationship created in step 1 is now updated to be the date of the lobbyist most recent authorization with ANY principal.
Expected result - Auth date in the principal's lobbyist grid should reflect the date the principal authorized THAT SPECIFIC LOBBYIST
Actual result - The principals lobbyist grid is displaying an authorized date for the lobbyist relationship based on the lobbyist most recent auth with ANY principal rather than that specific principal.
Examples in prod - Principal 11709 relationship with Lobbyist 12881

DAD gave us a filer who was able to renew into 2024 and did not see the registration fee applied. 11687 Jeffrey Mcgowan
Note - I tried to reproduce this in UAT and I got the registration fee.
In prod, user had a conversion 2023 registration in the system.
They went to renew into 2024 and added a new principal
No registration fee was applied.
Expected - Registration fee should be applied any time a user registers or renews (assuming they don't check the box to be exempt)
Actual - Registration fee was not applied to this user.
Issue is that the Registration Renewal and Fee assessment are not an atomic operation, but occur sequentially. The control logic is running via the client's browser (javascript). A well-timed closing of the browser after the registration but before the fee assessment will result in a client's registration without a fee.

We are having issue that we have each election. When county is deleting 1 record from the single voter participation it is deleting both records and deleting the Absentee record along with it.

Again we have had this issue every election and counties are frustrated.

Correct municipal precinct and combo will show for Mineral County poll places

A potential issue in Mineral County, here. For folks in
precinct 13 (both county and municipal), their voting locations are appearing
properly as shown below on the voter record – county/state/federal elections
are held at The Life Center, and city elections are held at Ridgeley City Hall.
An example ID is 100820781.
However, when I navigate to Election Management > Poll
Place > Maintain Polling Place > Page 8… There is no information for the
Ridgeley City Hall municipal location. I would think that at least the
municipal precinct and combo number would appear.
Can confirm that the proper precinct and combo
are appearing for the Life Center county polling location, though, so that’s a
plus. I also confirmed that precinct 13 does, indeed, exist on the UI. Please

The timestamp on the bottom of the Authorization forms should reflect the date/time when the registration including the authorization was fully approved by an admin. What appears to be happening is that the timestamp is that of the original approval of the registration for the Employer.

Expected Results:
Timestamp on Authorization Form from an Employer in a Lobbyist Registration packet should be on or after the signature date (no time machines involved).
Timestamp
on Authorization Form from an Employer in a Lobbyist Registration packet should
match the date/time when the Employer registration authorizing the Lobbyist was accepted by an admin user.
Actual Results:
Timestamp on Authorization Form from an Employer is often before the signature date on the Authorization form (implying time travel).
Timestamp on Authorization Form from an Employer in a Lobbyist Registration packet seems to match the original registration date for the Employer.

Happening in production (entities 14158072-0161 14503189-0160), reproduced using same entity in migration, also reproduced using a new entity in QA (work order W2024102308859, entity 14504163-0161)
Log in inhouse
Create work order for a Foreign LLC (happens with other entity types too, not just F-LLC)
Enter all necessary information
When you get to the Principal Office Address tab, enter a zip code of 84117 and select Salt Lake City in the dropdown
Complete all the other required information
Complete and approve the filing
Create a new work order for a Registration Information Change Form for the newly created entity (this also happens during an amendment filing - probably others too)
Select entity on Search Existing Entity tab
When you get to the Principal Office Address tab and change Salt Lake City to Holladay (and check Mailing Address same as principal office address) - you don't need to change anything else
Go through the other tabs until you get to the review screen
Note that in the principal office address section - the mailing address is correct (although Holladay is listed twice, which is weird), but the street address city has reverted back to Salt Lake City
Complete the filing
Go to Office Correction and open up the entity
In the Principal Office Address section, update the City to Holladay again
Add a note and press continue
See that the City has once again reverted back to Salt Lake City on the review screen, and after clicking Update, search the business and it's still Salt Lake City instead of Holladay
Current functionality: There's no way to change the Principal Office Street Address physical address city from Salt Lake City to Holladay when the zip code is 84117 if Salt Lake City was selected at formation
Expected functionality: The city can change to Holladay if needed - during any filing or using Office Correct
Something similar is happening when the Zip in the Principal Office Address is 84003, and American Fork is selected as the City. When you hit continue, everything saves except the City, which goes back to blank. (tested with entity 14504572-0160)
Also happening with 84107 - it will not allow Murray to be selected (only allowing Millcreek)

@Shreya Nyapati
@Rina Pilli
- Issue has been resolved. Please re-test.

Somehow, some Annual Report filings (both with and without changes, and with a variety of entity types) have been brought inhouse for review. Some work orders that have come inhouse (there are more, but this is a few examples):
W2024102381268
W2024101460628
W2024100233934
W2024101460658
I have tried replicating in all lower environments and have not been able to - but there are now a whole bunch that have been sent inhouse
Possibly related to: 78617
I say it's possibly related to that story, because of this one particular work order that was submitted (the internal review screen asks a question about annual benefit report, even though it's not a benefit corp or llc):

Sent an email to Martha, they need to add that report for the filer, or the filer needs to delete the transaction.

As configured, fines are not incrementing the $50/day until the day after they are imposed. E.g. if a report is due on 10/15, a fine is added for $0 on 10/16 and incremented every business day thereafter until filed or the maximum fine amount is reached. The fine should start out at $50 on 10/16 and increment after that. For future fines this can be fixed by adding a Base Amount to the fine of $50. But for existing, open, non-maximized fines, we need to add a base amount of $50 to the fines.

Below is the email from Tarrant that I mentioned in this morning’s call I was going to send to you and open ticket.
Here are their comments: PLEASE provide ANSWERS.
On 10/24, there were two files uploaded between the 9:10 and 12:17 times shown in the screenshots:
Tarrant checked both files (along with several files all the way back to 10/18) and
only found the voters in one file )vru_20241024_1 file
).
Each
one of the voters had 1 row in that file uploaded to TEAM, and all 3
had an Event Type, which tells TEAM to send a new voter in Pending
status back through Live Check to be re-evaluated and activated.
Tarrant
says they see no reason why an event would have occurred at 9:10 from
the files shown above - and definitely no Event Type 1's, which tell
TEAM to create a new voter.
The
file TEAM sent back only included the 2 active voters (using an Event
Type 99 - which activates the voters). Reyes was not in the response
file, so he didn't get activated.
The
only difference Tarrant sees between the 3 voters is that Reyes
responded to an incomplete notice and was sent back to TEAM once before
he was sent back in this most recent file. The other two were only sent
back to TEAM in this most recent file.
Tarrant wants to know
where the 9:10pm events came from
and
why Mr. Reyes has not be returned in a response file
.
we believe that this issue was caused by the same issue we saw over the weekend with Denton where the files were submitted with names in the incorrect fields/ incorrect codes being sent. Can the county review everything and make sure that records are submitted correctly?

Current Functionality: When an online Domestic Business Corporation amendment filing is sent inhouse, the inhouse review screen is showing the Voting New Members question from the Domestic Nonprofit Corporation.
Expected Functionality: The inhouse review screen should only show the Type and Shares, as those are the only things Domestic Business Corps are asked to provide.

Votec just sent us feedback about the Possible Dup update on some records. Please see below and I will also open a ticket.
We've reviewed a number of records both in the Possible Duplicate portal in TEAM and the "work ASAP" dup lists forwarded to customers by their TEAM reps and the overwhelming majority of them are not actual duplicates.
The issue here is that the voter requested a mail ballot and then decided to early vote and the mail ballot was cancelled. The AC or AS code was sent to TEAM (we have confirmed this with the reference #) but this code is not being applied to the AM record that was sent previously and they continue to look like they have a live mail ballot and are showing as duplicate voters.
Examples of this are voter 1072534831 - TOURIGNY,ARMANTINA ROSAS in Cameron County
and 1004243189 - CREEL, BOBBIE NELL in Harris.
So if you could take a look at this because Harris alone has over 1,300 voters on their duplicate voting portal and my guess is most - if not all - of them are because of this discrepancy and not actual duplicates.
The only methods that we are considering for Possible Dups are AV, EV & ED.
Fixed with the AC/AS code updates.

Atascosa had EV history cleared and needs possible dup dashboard cleared ASAP so they can upload.

CRITICAL - TEAM Duplicate Logic - not accounting for AC and AS codes
Reported from VOTEC.
The issue here is that the voter requested a mail ballot and then decided to early vote and the mail ballot was cancelled.
The AC or AS code was sent to TEAM
(we have confirmed this with the reference #)
but this code is not being applied to the AM record
that was sent previously and they continue to look like they have a live mail ballot and are showing as duplicate voters.
Examples of this are voter
1072534831 - TOURIGNY,ARMANTINA ROSAS in Cameron County
1004243189 - CREEL, BOBBIE NELL in Harris.
So
if you could take a look at this because Harris alone has over 1,300
voters on their duplicate voting portal and my guess is most - if not
all - of them are because of
this discrepancy and not actual duplicates.
VOTEC
Please see the PRs attached.

We need to run a query/ update to a number of voters. Because of the holiday this month, voters who have a registration date of 10/7 are getting pushed into having an EDR of 11/6. We will need to change the EDR for those voters to be 11/5
Updated all voter records to set EDR = 05-NOV-24 where
EDR was 06-NOV-24 and Reg Date was '07-OCT-24'.
Also update Audit records.

When selecting a previous year on the calendar's "Year" drop down, user is unable to select any future year past the selected year.
For example if user selects 1995 in the calendar's "year" drop down, user cannot select 1996 - present.
There is a quick easy work around by selecting outside of the calendar box and reselecting it.

Navigate to Elections/Offices/Maintain Dates

Click the Year drop down and select any previous year
Select the "Year" drop down and try to scroll to select a future year.

Scheduled filing periods in an Election Cycle or Filing Cycle must not have overlapping date ranges for the reporting period. When the system generates reporting periods on the creation of an Election Cycle or Filing Cycle, it ensures that reporting periods do not overlap. However, if a filing period is manually added after an Election Cycle or Filing Cycle is created, no such check is apparent and overlapping reporting periods can be created.

Issue:
Some (about 5) lobbyists in GA prod are shown in year 2026 after renewing into the 2025 cycle (GA gave 568528 as an example). GA said they have had over 250 lobbyists renew or register into 2025 and only about 5 are showing year 2026. GA wants the years for these lobbyists changed to 2025, We also need to find what is common between these lobbyists to find the root cause of the issue in the code.
Screen Shots
Root cause is not yet determined, but it appears that the front-end randomly sends an incorrect registration year to the back-end which the back-end blindly accepts.
Resolution was to not blindly accept the registration year but to look it up via the election cycle.
Since the issue is not reproducible, unsure how to QA. It appears that ~5% of lobbyist registration renewals were affected.

Happening in production, replicated in migration
When migrated entities are going through the Annual Report / Renewal with changes process online, they get through all the tabs, but then get the red X when they're in the shopping cart
Below is what I believe is the issue, from my testing. If something else is identified as causing the issue, it'll need addressed as well.
In the migration environment, I tested on the same entities. I noticed that the migrated entities appear to not have a Mailing Address on the record
On the Principal Office Street Address tab, I checked the box to edit it, and added a mailing address - this allowed me to complete the filing without getting the red X error
This is fine for the entities that require a mailing address, but what needs to be fixed here is that we need to add validation to that screen, so that they are required to enter the mailing address

The rejected reason in TEAM chosen:
data fix, but we need code change in future, please create new ticket for future sprint.

Galveston needs possible VH dashboard cleared after clearing EV history. Need as soon as possible!
Data fix.

From Martha Currier:
Looking on the public site, top payee #3 is Alan Miller. However, no Alan Miller appears in their expenditures.
As you can see from the attached download, Alan Miller, is showing as what they entered as the Print Mail of Maine on their reports. When you look at the list of expenditures from the admin side, it is correct – Print Mail of Maine for $2,935 and $516.95.
Can you dig into this and correct the data? AND any idea why the system went haywire and decided to do its own thing????!!!!
The following has been run in UAT and Production. Can you verify all looks good?
update member set firstname = null, lastname = null where MemberID = 392220;

When a county has to make a correction to their results mapping, the correction does not display on the Mapping page. Marion had the issue with a candidate, and Martin had the issue with referendums.
Marion County mapped this candidate incorrectly:
After correcting the error, the mapping table no longer displays the Vendor Value:
Same when clicking the pencil to edit the mapping:
But the mapping extract shows that the change was saved:
Correction was made after mapping had already been completed:
There were also 2 precincts that had not been mapped:
...and when the county fixed them, they showed up:
Fixed issue with empty values

Issue: Tucker County ran a Early Voter report which had 1121 voters shown for the total on page 162. However, on page 163, it says that there were 1120 voters at their one early voting location. The 1121 total appears to be correct so what is happening with the by poll place section?
AC: The Total Voters by Poll Place count will be accurate.

One more for "Brett Bartholomew", but they didn't give me an entity name or number... waiting for that
Transaction type ID populated

Previously sent this to Mandeep in Teams. Creating a bug here for tracking purposes:
Whomever completed this work order force approved it shortly after we went live, even though it didn't actually select the entity on the entity selection tab. So the system created a new entity instead of updating that existing entity. So the new one needs to be deleted, and the existing one needs all of the information that actually should have been updated from the work order...
This is a mess, but hopefully we can get it sorted out... here's what's needed...
Entity 11051993-0151:
Principal Office Address (physical and mailing) needs updated to 1081 E 700 S, St George UT 84790,

Registered Agent needs to be updated to Jordan Lee Harns w/address 1081 E 700 S , St George, UT, 84790 (last updated date 10/9/2024 8:53:04 AM)
THEN, after all of that is done.... entity 14504820-0151 will need to be deleted. Hard deleted.

team to tell what action was taken on this date?)

tell if this was an OVR, DMV, or a paper edit that was entered by the county?
Nothing is showing under change reason)
She alleges that she submitted an OVR on September of 2023,
but we have no record of such on our end. It’s a shot in the dark, but does the
CIVIX team have any record of an update for her in 2023? Further, she is
currently registered as No Party Affiliation, but claims that she should be

We have reports from the state after running the fix for the ticket above. Multiple counties (Travis, Brazoria, Tarrant, and Dallas) are all reporting high numbers in the duplicate dashboard after reloading their data. Many of the entries are showing the incorrect logic still happening with the AS/AC codes being included.
I checked the ABBM module for this voter and they only have the ballot listed as mailed, not accepted. Looked at a few other voters and they have the same situation.
Fixed by the ticket mentioned above.

Users can submit applications through OLAB without selecting a delivery type or filling in values for email or fax. (These should be required) When it's close to the election date, the OLAB form doesn't display checkboxes for available election types. This allows users to submit applications with blank data since the site doesn't offer fields to enter that data if no election types are selected.
There are rows from 2020 and 2022 in similar timeframes that also have blank delivery types.
It might be a DST issue, since the SQL to get available elections is using timezone operations to check if the deadline has passed.
Enhancement: when too close to the deadline, they should only be allowed to select online applications, and they should be required to enter email or fax
Code change to keep election checkboxes visible on day of deadline, which makes the delivery method and fax/email fields visible and required.

Hello Dara,
please take a look at the 2 attachments. On July 10th, I purge the SFIs from 15 & 16 filing years. If you go to the Public site,
the 2
years still appear as an option to search, and even though I found no records for 2015, the search for 2016 shows 4138 SFIs. I would like you to have your team do 2 things:
1 - Fix the purge for 2016 and remove the SFIs from that year.
2 - Remove 2015 and 2016 from the dropdown list of years to search against.

The Late Filing Fine for reports due 5 days before an election are assessed incorrectly in code and have an invalid configuration. The reports were due on 10/31 and fines should have been assessed on 11/1 with a Penalty Period Begin Date of 11/1. Additionally, the fines were configured with a $50/day increment starting on day 2. That should have been starting on day 1. Data correction needs to occur to set the Penalty Period Begin date to 11/1/2024 and the increment starting on day 1. This needs to be done for any CFIS filer (PAC or Candidate) who had a report due on 10/31 and has an outstanding fine.

Earlier today Montague noticed over 425 duplicates on their dashboard.
The two files below were checked for VUID#
1003844300 but duplicates were not found.
The county confirmed they did not upload their voting history more than once for 10/31. I checked to see what files were uploaded from 10/31 to 11/5:
TE Edit- We need to see if they uploaded things before or after we did the data/ code fix last week. They never requested a clear out from the dashboard and I want to know if this is just down to the county needing to reset their EV counts and we clear the count out.
Duplicate dashboard cleared.

Got a report that the EV page for Election Day turnout is not working correctly. It's showing as 0 for most counties while a few have the timing. We need to fix this early in the morngin.
As election day nov 5th is passed generic query is not taking the election id's. Updated the query

See the below from AP regarding data feed.
Need to have this looked into asap.
I checked the data file and see those races and the counties, but need to be sure. Please let me know what you find.
Hi Julia,
Hope you had a nice night!
We have an issue in the feed file we haven’t experienced before. Many counties did not update all races on election night.
One example is Armstrong County. Results are on the state website for all races, but we only got results for Supreme Court 2, 6 and State Board of Ed 15 via the feed file.
Another example is Gregg. We only received Supreme Court 2, 6 and State House 7.
There are
38 counties
where we do not have results for US Senate, Railroad Commissioner and other races.
This is causing a huge amount of work for us to try and manually enter these results into our system for all these counties from your website.
Would it be possible to please turn back on the feed so we can diagnose why these results did not show up?
We are just now seeing the extent of the issue after being tied up with other things.

When selecting "All Years "for the Calendar Year, not all will display. The lobbyist below, Mabelys Melton has records for 2023 and 2024. When I select all years only one principal displays for 2024. She has 4 for 2024.
JG 12/4 Notes - Purpose of this ticket is to resolve the "ALL Years" view for lobbyist on the public site view lobbyist view. This was resolved on the NM code branch so you can likely leverage the solution from there. Currently the behavior is inconsistent - initial view only shows 1, trying to expand pagination throws an error, and other times pagination won't expand at all. As part of this ticket, would like to default the dropdown to "ALL years".

Below is what the client submitted. These are the quick details about the issues being reported:
On the Name Change tab, even though the classification was changed to a Professional Corporation, the identifiers are expecting regular corporation identifiers instead of professional corporation identifiers
Changing the classification should change the UTC number at the end of the EntityID
Submitted amendment for business corp. Started processing and I did a change of entity type to a professional corp. When searching new name I just searched the original name (Roses are Red Co) and it said name was available however a professional corp is required to have PC, P.C. or Professional Corporation at the end of the name and system did not require nor alert that it was missing.
When I change Co to be PC it gave me this error. PC is the entity identifier. Professional Profit Corp isn't quite right with a entity type. Type is Professional Corp which I changed to from being a business (profit) corp.
I force accepted this one and it changed the entity subtype to professional corp but entity # still shows the last 4 digits of the entity # as 0142 however since now its a professional corp it should be 0144.
the first part of this is already being addressed in 80530. the second part is a change, so i'm removing this bug and creating a story instead

In the Voter Registration screen, the "Other" text field should only be displayed and enabled when the user selects "Other" from the Party dropdown. However, currently, the "Other" text field is displayed and enabled whenever any value is selected from the Party dropdown, even when it is not "Other."
Open the Voter Registration screen.
Select any value from the Party dropdown (other than "Other").
Observe that the "Other" text field is displayed and enabled, despite the Party field not being set to "Other."
Now, select "Other" from the Party dropdown.
The "Other" text field remains displayed and enabled only when the Party field is set to "Other."
Expected Behavior:
The "Other" text field should remain hidden and disabled until "Other" is selected from the Party dropdown.
Once "Other" is selected, the "Other" text field should be displayed and enabled for user input.
Actual Behavior:
The "Other" text field is incorrectly displayed and enabled even when a value other than "Other" is selected in the Party dropdown.

data fix in prod env

When the possible voter duplicate reaches 21, the Possible voter participation duplicate record screen will not create the 3rd page, with each pagination page maxing their count at 10. So 21st records should've created a 3rd page with one record showing. However, the 3rd page was not created.
Furthermore, continuing to add more possible duplicate records created the 3rd pagination page, only this time with one less record making the count off.
The possible duplicate records was added in SIT in Baylor County one by one with single voter participation function.

Request from Ric Thornton. Audit & Violations Report
Do you have the ability to go back and grab a Report for a
prior period?
I need the Aging for June 2024, but if I click on that
option from the drop-down list, the data on the spreadsheet includes violations
assessed post-June 2024.
I want the violations and amounts as of June 30, 2024.
Email to Ric -
It
looks like the Aging Report is grabbing everything no matter what month/year
you select. Let me check with Becky and see if that’s the way it was
originally designed, or if something has changed. I don’t think we have
made any updates that would have recently changed that report.
I’m
sure we can get a one off report for what you need, but we may not be able to
change the report functionality w/o a specific Change Order.
Let
me check.
Just
to verify, we are talking about the Reports> Audit & Violations:
Account Receivable Aging? And you are requesting just the ones dated in
June of 2024 or everything up to and including June of 2024?
Response from Ric:
Yes, it’s the Reports: Audits
& Violations: Accounts Receivable Aging.
I only need the one off
report for June 2024.
I believe the system has
always grabbed everything no matter the month/year selected. It was never
really a problem because I’ve never needed to look back…until now.
Reports>Audits & Violations: Accounts Receivable Aging. - Asking for a one off report of Audits up to and Including June 2024, nothing after.

Here is a screen shot: More reports after June of 2024 are listed below. The screen shot just didn't pick them up.
This was reported when Ric needed just a listing up to and including June 2024. It's been a bug for a long time and this is the first time, he's needed to go backward. Putting it in as a bug, which it is, but Becky got Ric a listing as a one off report, and that will work for now. Lowest priority, nothing needed on this one at this time.

Each of these work orders appears to have been force approved from online submission. The entity does not appear to have been created, and the filing document was sent out with no entity number.
We need to remove the force acceptance button from the internal review work orders
We also need to get these entities in the system - we're going to go back and do more testing to see if setting work orders back to pending, and then approving will allow these to work correctly.

This issue is working fine in QA Base, found the issue in TX and IA
Scenario:
Provide all the required fields on the voter registration form and give the DOB 01/01/2010 (underage)and click on NEXT button, the below alert is displayed. From this alert click on NO, the system closes the pop-up alert and remains on the voter registration page. (which is expected)
Now make no changes and click on the NEXT button
Expected Result:
the system should display the below pop-up warning message, until the user selects YES and then move to the REVIEW screen and display status as REJECTED
Actual Result:
the system is not warning the user as Incomplete registration and the pop up is not showing up and directly takes the user to REVIEW screen and the status is marked as ACTIVE for Underage voter.
Incorrect underage showing as ACTIVE status

2024 General - Putnam County vote totals were doubled on IndianaVoters.com.
Information from the county:
"
No, we did not do any mapping or upload any files on election night either during the primary or this general election. I entered the race totals into SRVS on election and night and then went in and entered the precinct-by-precinct totals on Thursday, November 7, 2024. I have already submitted the County Authorization Request to correct the display of results on IndianaVoters.com."

Kanawha mistakenly pulled a Mason County voter a while back. The record has since been corrected and pulled to Mason County, but the instance of 2024 General Participation in Kanawha needs removed from record 000499735 so that Mason County can properly enter her participation in their county. The 3 dots are not appearing for her to delete it on her end. Only the 2024 General needs removed, so please do not alter any other elections on her participation record.
If possible, can we get an ETA on how quickly this can be accomplished? The counties have begun work on updating provisionals, absentees, and inputting voter participation history.

County reports two issues related to mail
ballot status changing or not updating across different parts of TEAM.
There are two groups of ABBM/FPCA voters whose history has been updated,
but TEAM seems to be changing their status or not updating the other
parts of the voters’ records.
Issue 1:
5
voters, all of whom had one mail ballot cancelled and a second one
mailed, had their first ballots revert back to mailed status when their
second ballots were updated as received. Later, when the second
ballots were accepted, the original (cancelled, for a second time)
ballots changed from cancelled to received status.

Issue 2:
Other FPCA/ABBM voters have been
marked as having their ballots accepted, and the status shows
those ballots as accepted under Search Absentee, BUT on the Voting
History Participation tab (in their voter registration) does not show
them as having accepted mail ballots. This is an unknown number of
voters in Bowie County. But status should reflect once updated.

Issue:
When a user creates and saves a record for Participation History, the system should prepopulate the previously entered data when the user navigates back to edit that record. Currently, when users go to edit the record, some data fields are prepopulated correctly, while others are not.
Steps to Reproduce:
Search for a Voter and go to View
Navigate to Participation Tab
Create a new record in the Participation History section and save it.
Navigate back to the record list and click on the "Edit" button for the saved record.
Observe that some fields are prepopulated correctly, but others are missing or blank.
added/updated Participation history verified the mentioned fields

Issue:
When a user creates a record for Participation History and saves it, and then attempts to create another record for the same election, the system should display a message such as "The voter has already participated in this election" to prevent duplicate records. However, currently, when the user tries to create a duplicate record for the same election, the system returns a generic 500 OK error instead of the appropriate validation message.
Steps to Reproduce:
Search for a Voter and go to View
Navigate to Participation Tab
Create a new record in the Participation History section and save it.
Click on the "Add" button again and use the same election that was used in previous record
Click on the "Create" button
Restricted duplicate records for the same election date.

Issue:
When a user creates and saves a record for Participation History, the data entered on the record creation screen is not fully displayed in the Participation History list under the Participation tab. Specifically, fields such as "Request Location," "Ballot Sent Date," "Ballot Received Date," and "Ballot Status Reason" are not visible in the data grid. These fields should be displayed to provide a complete view of the Participation History record in the list.
Steps to Reproduce:
Search for a Voter and go to View
Navigate to Participation Tab
Create a new record in the Participation History section and save it.
Observe the data in the data grid in Participation Tab
Updated data models and participation history ts file
to include these values

Issue:
When a user creates and saves a record for Participation History, some fields such as "Method of Request," "Ballot Return Method," and "Ballot Status" are displayed as abbreviations in the Participation History list under the Participation tab. These fields should be shown with their full text.
Steps to Reproduce:
Search for a Voter and go to View
Navigate to Participation Tab
Create a new record in the Participation History section and save it.
Observe the data in the data grid in Participation Tab
Updated data models and participation history ts file
to include these values
.

Issue:
When a user creates and saves a record for Participation History, and then later attempts to update that record by changing some fields, the "Update" button does not function as expected. The system fails to update the record, and the changes are not saved. This issue is preventing users from successfully editing Participation History records.
Steps to Reproduce:
Search for a Voter and go to View
Navigate to Participation Tab
Create a new record in the Participation History section and save it.
Navigate back to the record list and click on the "Edit" button for the saved record.
Change some fields as needed
Click on the "Update" button

Submit a formation filing for a DBA
Log in inhouse and reject the work order
Go back to the Work Queue Dashboard and search through each queue for the work order
Current functionality: Work order can't be found in any work queue
Expected functionality: In house users can find rejected online work orders in the Online Rejected work queue
Work order I used in QA for testing: W2024101108266
I was able to update this in Queue Work Transaction Mapping, so I posted to the Monday board and closed it out.

An LLC application was filed on 09/30/2024 and approved on 10/15/2024 (W2024093028814: McIntyre Tile LLC). He also filed a name reservation on 10/03/2024 (W2024100336709: McIntyre Tile LLC), which I reviewed today and rejected due to the LLC app approval.
Why was the name reservation able to go through on 10/03 when the name was already taken by the LLC filing on 09/30? The system should have caught the conflict and prohibited the name reservation from taking place, correct?
I found a name conflict. A customer submitted a name reservation for B. Robert Clark Family Management Co. who planned to register it as a DBA. Due to the DBA registration process he couldn't register the DBA as it doesn't ask if they reserved the name nor for the release code. He then submitted the name B. Robert Clark Family Management. The Co. in the original name doesn't make a name different so he shouldn't have been able to register B. Robert Clark Family Management as a DBA.

Customer submitted a new LLC application for Purely Clean LLC and it was rejected due to a name conflict. He resubmitted with the name Dream Clean LLC and it was rejected. The rejection showed the previous name and that it was not available. This happened a 3rd time.
When he called today, I walked him through the resubmission. The new name was searched and showed available and submitted. I found it in the work order que. Everything was in order and I approved it.
Below is the email the customer received showing the original name and no entity number. I'm not sure what happened and where to cause this. The customer is fine with the original name but in the database, it shows the resubmitted name as well.
Replication Steps:
Log in online
Submit a filing for a Domestic LLC (likely happens with all online formation filings, but this is what was tested...)
Log in inhouse and reject the filing
Go back online the next day, open the filing, change the name, and resubmit the filing
Go back inhouse and find the same work order
Current functionality: The old name is on the work order and when the work order is completed, it creates an entity with the old name, but the documents that get sent out refer to both the old name and the new name
Expected functionality: The newly submitted name should show up on the work order and the internal review screen, the entity that gets created should have the new name, not the original name, and all correspondences and documents that get sent out should refer to the new name.
This is happening with any information that is updated in the online work order after rejection - the old information comes back to the internal review screen and also ends up on the stamped file copy instead of the new information (another example is entity 14514778-0143 - their original submission said the domicile incorporation date was 11/11/84. They updated it to 10/11/84 after the rejection, but it came back again showing 11/11/84 instead of 10/11/84, and after approval, that's what shows in our system)

Go back online and create an amendment filing for that professional LLC
Current functionality:
Professional Subtype isn't selected on the Business Classification tab
On the Name Availability Search tab, the "Select checkbox to update/provide information below." checkbox defaults to checked
The Name Availability Search tab is requiring a search, even when not changing the business name
Expected functionality:
Professional Subtype should default to whatever is on the entity
On the Name Availability Search tab, the "Select checkbox to update/provide information below." should not be checked by default
The Name Availability Search tab should only require a search if someone is changing the business name
Business Classification professional service was blank but it was there when I registered it
Name Availability Search section automatically has the Select checkbox to update already checked, and says that a search is required
If you uncheck it and click next it still says business name search was not performed. However there is no need to perform a search if name isn't changing.
However when I performed the search it said name was available. It didn't come up with a name conflict like the customers did.

As an SVRS user
I want to have Berkeley county voters credited for voting on election day
So that they are no longer incorrectly credited for early voting
AC: If possible, change the voter history for the attached Berkeley county voters from early voting participation to regular (Election day) voter participation
Notes from WV: Berkeley County had some issues with a voting machine on Election Day, and upon resolving the issue, this caused Election Day (regular) voters to be credited for Early Voting participation in SVRS.
Can the voters in the attached spreadsheet be changed to appear as having regular, Election Day history instead of Early Voting history? Or does the county have to edit each of the 473 voters? Hopefully that makes sense – just let me know if more information is needed.
Voter participation updated to regular, election day.

When the correspondence was generated for a filers with a balance of $5,000 on a fine, it showed a balance of $4,950 in the correspondence. This was for a single outstanding fine on a report filed 6 months and 5 days late (Due 10/10/23, Filed 4/15/24). The expectation is that the fine balance in the correspondence match that on the Fees and Fines tab assuming that they are calculated on the same date or are maxed out.

Select the entity on the Search Existing Business tab, then navigate to the Foreign Name Availability Search step
Don't do anything, and just move to the next tab
You can also replicate by creating a foreign LLC - on the Foreign Name Availability Search step, enter a domicile name that's already in use, click search, click Enter Alternate Entity Name and remove the entered domicile name, then enter an alternate name, click search, and continue. Complete and approve the filing, then create an amendment filing for the same entity.
Current functionality: T
he Domicile Name field is blank and does not stop the user from moving forward. When the filing is complete, it completes with no name, and erases the name that was previously there.
Expected functionality: If an alternate name exists instead of just a domicile name (or instead of a domicile name at all), that name should populate in the Foreign Name Availability Search tab in the amendment instead of the domicile name (or blank name).

I was trying to process a resubmission for a work order that I had rejected. I updated the work order to replace the old file with the corrected document, and then clicked the "Update Work Order" option, but then the record disappeared. I can no longer find the work order.
For some reason, when I look up the work order in the work order search, the work order detail has been cleared out. There is no information pertaining to the work order.

URGENT: Missing Races Canvass - Atascosa
TE Edit - Found part of the issue. The county certified their results before they finished their canvass. We need to uncertify their results because the state can't do it on the front end.
Atascosa:
“
I
was attempting to go back into my canvass to upload the documents
again, however, I’m now missing races as well as candidates from the
canvass list. I should have 8 additional county races and on the county
commissioner precinct 3 I’m missing candidate George “butch” Pawelek.
Can you please see what you can find out to assist with this issue.”
In terms of county races only County commissioner Pct 3 is showing on Atascosa’s canvass.
There are 8 additional races that should be on that screen.
County looks to have Certified the results causing winners to be chosen (removing them from canvass screen).
Need fixed immediately as this is due tomorrow.
Data fix pr attached

Good morning!
I noticed that when Candidates' profiles were updated for 2024 elections, the system added filing obligations for the non-election years as well.

I want to investigate why a voter's ballot status is incorrect

AC: If possible, investigate why the changes below occurred for Barbara Jane Summers 000632079 and fix the voter's ballot status if necessary
Notes from WV:
Please see the email from Monongalia County below regarding voter 000632079. Can someone help me understand what is happening here? I cannot investigate on my own in UAT, because that data is not the same was what is appearing in PROD.
Please take a look at:
Barbara Jane Summers 000632079
Civix had forced the Ballot Status to “SPOILED” and added “VOTER HISTORY ALREADY GIVEN” to the Ballot Status Reason when she voted at Early Voting. The ballot return date remained blank.
I went to update her record to enter a note that she surrendered her ballot at Suncrest EV and the system would not let me enter any type of note. It forced me to enter the ballot return date and it changed the SPOILED to RETURN PROVISIONAL, however when you look at the ballot return portal it is checked for spoiled and there is nothing that was ever flagged provisional.
I went in on an absentee record that was surrendered, to make a note of the date and location the ballot was surrendered. Civix had changed the ballot type to Spoiled and made a note that Voter history already issued when they imported the voter history from early voting. When I made an update to the record, it would not let me save and gave a message that I had to remove the challenge and add the date the ballot was returned. I verified there was not a challenge anywhere in the system, but it would not bypass the message. When I closed out and when back into the system, the spoiled was removed and replaced with challenged. I went to update again and there was still no challenge. I am home now, and can’t remember the voter’s last name, but I will get it and send it to you Monday to take a look at. It was weird.

This business has a pending status on the website (and no filing history is showing up). It was rejected for a name conflict, but then chat and they provided proof that they reserved the name. I then put it back into my queue and approved it. I do not know why it did not switch to approved, and I cannot access it in Office correct.
It was rejected it for a name conflict. After he was given proof that they owned the name conflict, I put it back into my queue and approved it. Possibly what caused this was that the staff user went and reprocessed a rejected work order, that the online user never actually resubmitted.

Ok another showstopper issue came up. Willacy county forgot to enter a candidate, so they never showed up on ENR or any of the other pages.

Terminating a relationship between a Lobbyist and an Employer does not mean that a new relationship cannot be established between the Lobbyist and Employer in the future. But the system is currently blocking that by not allowing a Lobbyist who has had a relationship with an Employer to be authorized again.

Work on behalf of the chosen Employer.
Amend their registration.
Click the Add Lobbyist button on the amendment form.
Attempt to add Vanessa Alarid as a Lobbyist.

It looks like Converted Candidates have Candidate Campaign Information associated with their records.

No matter who the candidate of committee, when entering a transaction, the same group of contributors/payees is being displayed when entering a contributor/payee.
The list that is being displayed is all the current candidates and committees. They are all Terminated and have not been used by the new committees.
They should not be in the results presented when using the type ahead for the contributor/payee.
Committees do not share Contributor/Payees. Only contributors/payees that have been entered by the specific committee should be returned in the type ahead results when entering contributors/payees.
The information being displayed in the type ahead results when entering transactions, does not appear to be the information from the VENDOR's List in Legacy either.

The ability to terminate a relationship between a Lobbyist and Employer needs to be available to non-admin users as well as admin users. This is supposed to be something done by the filer and not by an admin.

May we request a change request that requires a user to submit a request to the state before updating a voter’s social security number and driver’s license number? I know there is currently a flag that lets the user know that they are about to change the voter’s PII, but we need to enhance this feature, as we had a few counties incorrectly pull voters by overriding the flag.

In UAT - When trying to Amend/Correct Registration. Information from current registration is not pre-populating what information is from Legacy PROD. ABQ Workers First ID 7177. This is an issue with other MFC's too. Not just ABQ Workers First. See ABQ Fire PAC ID 7179, Sierra Club ABQ MFC ID 7180,

ABQ CFIS - Public Site>Explore>Candidates/Campaign Committees - remove Campaign Committees after Candidates and remove Ballot Questions. Since ABQ does not recognize Campaign Committees, this seems confusing. For ABQ should be Candidates.
implemented a feature flag to hide and show these items based on it

For this ticket - Expected outcome - Alphabetize the list.
UAT -
Something is wrong with the Occupation field on Edit Contributor/Payee
It's not the same as the "Occupation or Industry" dropdown on the Add Contributor, Add New Contribution.
Occupation Code Table in Legacy has a total of 32 Valid Options.
The current Occupation Code Table in ABQ UAT has 149 and it includes the Legacy 32 Options.
The options appear in different order on he New Contribution/New Contributor entry, vs the Edit Contributor/Payee info.
Occupation/Occupation Industry dropdowns need to be in the same order, the order on the Edit Contributor/Payee page looks like it's the NEW Codes then the Legacy Codes, the dropdown on New Contributor, looks like the two lists have been merged and are in alpha order.

This issue was found by Lisa during conversion testing. Certain converted candidates have addresses and emails, but that data does not populate on the front end even though the format matches that of newly registered accounts.
Environment:

Steps:
Log into ABQ UAT CFIS and work on behalf of converted filer 7019 or 7126.
Issue:
This was discovered looking at converted Candidate Tim Keller ID 7019 - No Candidate Address, or Candidate Email is showing on the Candidate/Committee Detail section,, but that information exists in the Legacy record.
Address Information is also showing up blank when logging in as an Admin, and Working on Behalf of (Entering the last name of Keller only).
Tim Keller ID 7107 is showing an Address in the Work on Behalf of grid, as well as in the Candidate/Committee Detail section and also has Committee Information Displayed. Legacy did not have any "Committee Information" associated with Candidates

Hey Phil,
I’m working on reports for the Early voted ballots for my HD 1 that were issued from other regions and sent down to me for counting. I have this one voter that shows she voted early at site 93-901 a HD 1 ballot but she is not included in the report when I run it by site 93901 but she does show up on the Excel report when I run it without a Site Id. Her Early vote record shows site ID 93901 and date voted of 11/05/24. The report I ran was for site id 93901 dates 11/1-11/5.
Can you look and see if you can figure out why she is not showing up on the 93901 report in PDF it should show 7 but it only shows 6 total

I want to get a daily report of Voter History for the 2024 general election
So that I can use the data for reporting purposes
it appears the View Voter History ad-hoc report
for the 2024 general has exceeded the 500,000 limit, so I can no longer run a
voter history report statewide.
Can we start receiving a voter history report
daily for the general that includes all voter history for the general. Can the
report match this adhoc report exactly, since I already have processes set up
using this report and format? Attached is an example. Below is the ad-hoc
report I have been using:
AC: Send a daily report file with the View Voter History that is identical to the AdHoc View Voter History but shows ALL records for the 2024 general election.

Issue:
When a voter is registered without a mailing address, and then updates any information other than the mailing address (e.g., party affiliation), the audit history incorrectly includes the mailing address in the change record. For instance, if the party affiliation is updated, the audit history displays both the party affiliation and mailing address, even though the mailing address was not modified.

When a user accesses the voter registration page to create a new voter, the "Status" field is empty by default and the "Status Reason" is also empty. The expected behavior is that the "Status" field should be set to "Active" by default, and the "Status Reason" should be empty. However, both fields remain empty until the page is manually refreshed.
Steps to Reproduce:
Navigate to the voter registration page.
Observe that the "Status" field is empty (instead of being set to "Active" by default).
The "Status Reason" field is also empty.
No default value is populated in these fields until the page is refreshed.
Refresh the page.
After refreshing, the "Status" field is populated with "Active" and the "Status Reason" is empty as expected.
Expected Result:
The "Status" field should be automatically set to "Active" by default when the voter registration page is loaded.
The "Status Reason" field should be empty by default.
There should be no need for a page refresh to populate these values.
Actual Result:
The "Status" and "Status Reason" fields are both empty when the voter registration page is first loaded.
Values for these fields appear only after the page is manually refreshed.

There are other work orders as well, but these are some examples.
Trying to open the image thinks for a while, but then returns the following error. This happened previously, and we thought it was a one-off with the one work order, but it has been happening again with additional work orders. With that one, we thought that it was not the size of the image causing the issue, because it was only a single page, but after additional research, I believe it was a file size issue because of how the image was being saved (see additional info below)
Per client: I think I figured out what was happening. When the doc was saved from customers email we saved it via Save as PDF which it did have the whole doc but when I printed the doc that was saved/uploaded it printed really big. So I saved the doc as a Microsoft Print to PDF from customers email as Fit to Paper. I attached and it opened the image in the work order and it let me process it. I have attached what printed when I printed the image.
This happened on another work order. The customer sent over the two files highlighted, and they are the ones that were causing the issue. "File 3" was the one that was saved differently, and it worked fine. I believe this is a file size issue based on how the files are saved. We may need to limit the size of uploaded files, so these massive ones can't be uploaded (online is limited to 4MB, but inhouse doesn't appear to be limited)
--> I used these files to replicate the issue in QA with this work order number: W2025010210486

After redacting an image in office correct and saving it, the unredacted image is still what is available in the online filing history (see entity 14501646-0151 in UAT or 14505757-0160 in QA- in office correct, you can see that there's a redacted image for the Certificate of Assumed and of True Name, but if you open the image online, it shows the unredacted version)
(Note: If the filing image is redacted during the work order processing, it does correctly open the redacted image.)_

On the .pdf of the Registration Form, for MCF's as well as Candidates. There are two Dates.
Today's Date, and a Certification Date that goes with the Signature of the Person Registering the Committee.
For Registrations that have been entered by an Admin User, and the Registration Date has been Back Dated, the Dates on the .pdf are switched.
The Back Dated Registration Date is showing up at the bottom of the form in the Certification Section, and the Certification Date that is defaulted to the current date, and is not editable, is showing up on the Top of the Form under Today's Date:

Steps:

Then you should be ready for the Certification section. In that section, check the affirmation box, then I entered the Treasurer's name, and the Date in the affirmation section is defaulted to the current date, and it is not editable.
Then click SUBMIT.
Registration is Submitted, Click FINISHED. Registration is Pending.
From Pending Registrations under Quick Links on the Admin Home page. Accept the Registration, of the Committee just registered, from the Actions menu on the Pending Registrations data grid.
Working on Behalf of 37698
From the Candidate/Committees Details page, click VIEW REGISTRATION.
On the Registration.pdf, Todays Date is showing 11/1/2024. This was the Backdated Registration date. (This is correct).
On the Registration.pdf, the date in the Certification Section, is showing as 11/1/24 which is the Registration Backdated date, NOT the date that was entered when the committee was registered for the Certification Date. On Committee Registration, that date defaults to the current date 11/26/2024 and is not editable. So on Registration that date was 11/26/24.
I am getting different results with a different MFC that was added earlier today, the same way, as an Admin User, from the Secure Site. This is committee "Clean Up ABQ". ID 37694
I added it earlier, it is showing different results on the Registration form .pdf.
It was backdated with 11/1/2024 on Registration as well, but it's showing Today's Date on the Registration form as 11/26/2024, and it;s showing the Certification Date of 11/1/2024.
There are three Dates on this registration form. Emily has indicated that the Certification Date should be the current date, even if the Registration was backdated.
Not sure why when I registered Clean Up ABQ, Dates were different?
Registered another committee - 2nd Registration Test Date Committee ID 37709 - as an Admin, backdated the registration to 11/1/2024.
It the Registration Date of 11/1/2024, and the Certification date of 11/1/2024 as well. Also shows the Certification date of 11/1/2024.
Registering a New Candidate seems to be displaying all the same date as the Backdated Registration Date as well.
Registered as Administrator - Chico Hatkee ID 37713
Not sure what happened, with the 1st one I did. I have now registered 2 additional MFC's and one Candidate Committee. They all have the same date everywhere on the registration form as the backdated registration date, however the date that displayed on the Registration for the Certification we the current date, the form is displaying the Backdated Registration Date.

I rejected this filing and the customer then sent me the corrected document via email. I tried to edit the work order and uploaded the new document. When I try to update the work order it is giving me this error and I have no idea where to find the merger fee structure. This is a commercial registered agent that I am trying to file.
When you click on Edit work order, delete the scanned file, upload a new file, and then hit save, it's returning an error that says "Please select merger fee structure"

During the 2024 General, Pike County reported to BT that it was missing the CEB-11 for its local offices. Kevin found 13 counties that needed it added and quickly remediated.

BT is tracking this only for the Pike County issue.

This ticket is related to the Medina rebounding ticket for absentee ballots.
Issue
: When an absentee ballot is created, cancelled, and then deleted, the ballot still shows as cancelled in the Single voter participation history.
I double checked "view registration"-view voter history and voter participation, along with the "individual reports" and they all still show the deleted ballot.
Another interesting thing about this bug, is it can only be reproduced if the VUID has other existing participation history records. Cannot be reproduced if they have no election history.
AC.
Should be able to delete cancelled absentee ballots without the records still showing in the SVP, Participation history, Registration participation history, and Reports.
Deleted the cancelled ballot below
SVP page still shows as cancelled
Voter participation still shows the ballot but missing the ballot status
Inquiry - view voter registration - voter participation history still shows the cancelled ballot
The individual record also still shows this record but as received status instead of it being deleted
prerequisite - Have a VUID with some existing participation records. They cannot have a blank participation history
Log in as county user
Navigate to Activities > Absentee Ballots > Search Absentee Ballots and type in the VUID with some existing participation history records.
Click the add button to add absentee ballot
Select the election date - name and fill in the date application received and date applicate accepted/rejected
Click + next to the "Send Absentee Ballot" section and pick a "Date ballot mailed"
Click the Save button
Select the ballot that was just created and click update
Scroll down to "Receive or Cancel Absentee Ballot and select the Cancelled option
Fill in the date ballot cancelled and reason and click save button
Select the ballot that was just updated and delete the ballot
Navigate to Activities > Maintain Voter History > Single Voter Participation and search the same VUID
observe that the deleted ballot is still there.
Next check the Voter participation history in Inquiries and observe there as well
Next check the Voter registration - voter participation history and observe there as well
Next check the individual voter report and observe the record there.

When Registering an MFC, the system is requiring the same Financial Institution information as if it were a Publicly Financed Candidate.
Privately Financed Candidates are only required to provide Branch and Name of Bank/Financial Institution and Phone. (Per User Story 79862).
Initially all Financial Information was required for both Private and Public Candidates and MFC's.
For Privately Financed Candidates ABQ ask us to hide all the information required for the Publicly Financed Candidate, making only Branch and Name of Bank/Financial Institution and Phone required.
No mention of MFC's. Since MFC's are Privately Financed, it would make sense that they should only be required to provide the same information as the Privately Financed Candidates.
Hide or Remove Street Address, Apartment, Building, Suite, etc. City, State & Zip for MFC's, - Leaving only Branch and Name of Bank/Financial Institution and Phone, making it just like Privately Financed Candidates.

Happened in production. Attempted to replicate in Migration with work order W2024112705928, but it worked as expected - only the one transaction got rejected instead of all of them.
Work order was submitted on 10/15/24 with 2 amendments and 3 annual reports (W202410562745)
The 3 annual reports were automatically approved, and the 2 amendments came inhouse
One amendment was approved
The next amendment was rejected
When one transaction in the work order was rejected, the system grabbed all 5 transactions from that work order, and changed them all the Pending Resubmission
The one that was intentionally rejected got resubmitted and then approved, but now the other 4 are showing as Pending Resubmission instead of Approved
See 4 of the 5 transactions now showing in the Rejected Filings queue
Receipt that shows the 3 transactions that were auto approved on 10/15:
Receipt from 11/12 showing that the 1st amendment was approved:
Rejection letter that was sent out on 11/12 to all the other entities in the work order, even though they had all already been approved
Filing history shows the filings, but with a status of "Pending Resubmission" instead of Approved
I don't think this is still an issue. Everything is fine on this work order/entity, so I'm removing this. I'll reopen it if they think there's still a problem.

The calendar display in the Effective Date Entry section of the Domestic Limited Liability Company Registration Information Change Form is not allowing the selection of a date prior to today's date (12/3/24), even though the Received Date was 11/15/24.
The user CAN type in the correct date, and it allows them to move forward, but the calendar should allow selection of any date from the Received date to 90 days in the future of that date.

When maintaining Holidays in the Lobbying module, the code table does not display the date of the holiday and when adding/editing, continues to show the date field as required even when it has been supplied.

There are still issues with the entity selection on the DBA Renewal filings
Received Date of filing must be within 60 days before entity's Expiration Date or 35 days after its Expiration Date
Rejection:
Short: Renewal filed too late.
Long: The receipted date for this renewal falls outside of the established filing window. Renewals need to be filed within 30 days of expiration, and this was submitted too late and needs to be resubmitted as a new DBA application.
Rejection:
Short: Renewal filed too early.
Long: The receipted date for this renewal falls outside of the established filing window. The filing window opens 60 days before the report is due. Please resubmit at that time.
Entity does NOT have to be in a status of Active. If the status is Inactive/Expired, as long as the work order Received Date is less than 35 days after the Expiration Date, it should be allowed.
The filing window and status requirement should apply both inhouse or online (only inhouse appears to be having issues - online is working as expected)

Issue 1: I copied and pasted 3 separate lines form my rejection reasons/instructions yet on letter they are combined into paragraph format. Customers tend not to read everything or follow all instructions when in paragraph format. Having separate lines for each reason when copying and pasting or typing reasons is best.

Here is what I copied and pasted:

Data fix.

When making a change to reporting periods and using the Regenerate Assignments to propagate those changes to filers, the system is adding filing obligation that date to prior to the filer's earliest registration date. What should happen is only that any new reporting periods added by an admin or changes to existing reporting periods that affect reports not yet filed and after the original registration date should be assigned to a filer.

As an SVRS user
I want to have a data fix
So that the voter participation history is shown as "YES" in the counted column
AC: Change the "Counted" column in the voter participation history to show "YES" for the following two voters
Katrina Tichnell (100160897) and Debra Sue Phillips (000850928).
Notes from WV:
Please see the email from Taylor County below. I know this is a known issue, but can we request a data fix so that under Voter Management > Search Voter Information > View Voter Information > Voter Participation History, it shows as “YES” in the counted column? The two voter names and IDs are highlighted.
Nothing needs changed under Voter Management > Election Participation History > Other Voter Participation. All is correct there.
I entered each provisional ballot, marking those that counted as having the challenge removed. When I look at the voters through that part of Civix, it shows that the voter's vote counted. BUT, when I look at the voter and the voter's election participation history, it shows that the voters count did not count. Thus, when I run a total election report, my totals are off the number of our provisional ballots.
Even when we look up the voter through your portal, like we were the voter checking our vote, it shows that their vote counted.
The two voters we have reviewed and found this mistake are
Katrina Tichnell (100160897) and Debra Sue Phillips (000850928).

Brittany has emailed and called Gordon. The New SOS (Elected in Nov of 24) has filed a Pre-Candidate Declaration for the 2028, and has transactions to report.

Becky found a bug from Dec of 2023, Bug # 62243 that Parker has already worked on for what sounds like a similar issue!

For the 2025 filing year, NM opened the registration on Dec 4, 2024. Filing filed before the end of the year are using the date the report was filed to derive the Filing year in the header of the report. This data point should be pulled from the Election Cycle for the year that they are filing for.
NOTE
- this has not been an issue in the past as the registration for filing was synched to the calendar year, so a filer would not have had the opportunity to file prior to Jan 1.

From Julie, the important parts are highlighted in the lower section: this is complete and results can be seen on his 2024 assignments; details below... NOTE: He is now in the 2025 cycle and none of his soft deleted assignments are in that cycle... even worse, he has no assignments for that cycle... is that cycle configured? Do we have another issue such that configured assignments are not given upon renewal?
Filer was Inactive (see RegStatusCode = I in second set of results) then became active.
Filer has 2 relationships that have AuthorizationStatus = 'A' (are active) the rest are Terminated. Those that are Active are only State Lobbying Level (see last set of results). So, need to make active any LSLR assignments which are soft deleted.
Also, there are some that are soft deleted but have already been filed (see third set of results and highlighted in blue). Not sure what report type they originally were given they are now LNA
(
BIG ISSUE
- Need a bug to ensure the reporting assignment does not change when they do a filing with no activity... the Report record can indicate that but the assignment should not)
So, will flip the IsDeletedFlag for all those highlighted in blue (some he already filed and some which are LSLR which he has not yet filed).

When adding an absentee ballot request for voters, the system exhibits incorrect validation behavior for certain voter ages. The issue occurs irrespective of the age of the voter, resulting in either incorrect validation messages or incorrect ballot rejection.
Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Passed
Add a voter with a date of birth making them
16 years old.
The system correctly identifies the voter as underage and displays the correct validation message. Validation works as expected.
Scenario 2: Failed
Add a voter with a date of birth making them
17 years old
(eligible for absentee ballot if turning 18 by the election). The system validates the voter as eligible if they turn 18 by the election. The system incorrectly rejects the ballot request, displaying an "underage" rejection message.
Scenario 3: Failed
Add a voter with a date of birth making them
20 years old.
The system should validate the voter as eligible and accept the ballot request. The syste
m incorrectly rejects the request, displaying an "underage" rejection message for a voter who is clearly not underage.

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to scan in voter history barcodes
So that no error shows up when the voter's history is successfully updated
This error was not reproducible in lower environments
AC: Investigate the cause of the error, remove the error so that it does not appear when the scanning is successful
Notes from WV:
Please see the attached image from McDowell County. When attempting to scan in voter history, she scans up to 5 barcodes at once, and when she goes to click insert to credit them, she receives a message that the voter has already voted. She knows this is not true, as they are still working through all of their pollbooks. Crystal is confident that she has not scanned in duplicate barcodes or pollbooks.
After she received this message, she reviewed a voter’s record and found that the history does, indeed, “stick” So they are properly credited… but it’s misleading because when scanning them in, the message indicates that the voter couldn’t be credited again since they’ve already voted.
This is happening with all voters, and even when she just attempts to scan one at a time.

As and SVRS user I want to be able to send records back to the source county by clicking the ellipse next to the records and selecting "Back to Source County"
Currently there is a work around by selecting Change County and selecting the original county the record is from.

An OOPS error has resurfaced. State user > Dashboard > Unmatched Records > Voter Applications > Ellipse by voter record > Back to Source County:
I was able to send it back to the county by using the “Change County” option, and selecting the original county. But it would be nice if we could use the “Back to Source County” button instead.

Issue: VR batches are attaching the documents, but not attaching the signatures
Notes from AK:
I created a couple of VR batches and noticed that it’s not catching signatures. I tried several different types of VR batches, but none of them seem to have worked – FCD, DMVP, OTH. It’s doing the same thing that it did with the Question floppies. It will attach the document, but not the signature. There have been a few other times recently that I’ve noticed documents that were attached without signatures, so I thought VREMS might be having issues with attaching signatures in general.
After my brain was refreshed, it seems it is likely that it is the setting on your scanner – something must have been changed, it is not a VREM issue. The settings in VREMS capture the signatures and are universal for all users. At some point, all of the scanners have been set to capture correctly, so something must have changed on your end. We have had no other reports.
Below is an example of the VREMS settings for the FCD. If you are still having issues, you may want to get someone from George’s group (Wyatt?) to help you.
HOWEVER, this particular example shows that FCD does NOT capture both the card and the signature. So this must not be normal for this kind of document. See the example after this for the DMVP (CO3).
Tyler from IT came out and checked our computers/scanners today. He thinks this is a VREMS issue.
We can get signatures to scan to the record if we upload them as support docs, but not VR batches.
We just walked through this with Heather and it is capturing the signature and uploading, but when going to the voter record the signature record is not available in Display Signature. The Reg doc is available in Display Document, but no signature in Display Signature. This is happening with all types of manual batching.
Phillip says the application is putting a NULL in the VOTER ID for the signature.

When a Lobbyist/Employer relationship is terminated and then subsequently reinstated a new Authorization Form is added to the registration packet as expected. However, the Authorization Date on the new Authorization Form is the same as the Authorization Date on the original Authorization Form. Since this is a new relationship, it should instead have the date when the Employer authorized the Lobbyist the second(or subsequent) time.
NOTE
- For clarity, this may require steps to terminate and re-authorize be taken on separate days to see what is happening
Login to the Lobbyist module
Work on behalf of an Employer - preferably one with a single Lobbyist authorized some months or years in the past (ID 134611 used as example)
Terminate the relationship with the Lobbyist. (Vanessa Alarid used as example)

Amend the registration to re-add the Employer
Work on Behalf of the Employer again
Amend the registration to re-authorize the Lobbyist
As an Admin - accept the registration amendment
View the Registration packet for the Employer from the latest amendment
Expected Results:
After the re-authorization of the Lobbyist, the registration packet should contain two Authorization Forms for the Lobbyist
The first
Authorization Form for the Lobbyist should have the original Authorization Date
The second Authorization Form for the Lobbyist should have the new Authorization Date
Actual Results:
After the re-authorization of the Lobbyist, the registration packet does contain two Authorization Forms for the Lobbyist (
Correct
)
The first
Authorization Form for the Lobbyist should have the original Authorization Date

UAT
- Emails are currently being sent to Ethics.Commission@maine.gov & Campaignfinancetest@gocivix.com from the CFIS application.
None of the data has been updated in UAT for quite some time. The Filing Reminders, and Late Filing Reminders are clogging up the Ethics Commission's Mailbox, and they have ask us to turn them off.
We can disable the entire service for UAT only, or could we just remove the email address of Ethics.Commission@maine.gov?
That way if Civix ever needed to test anything in Maine UAT, we would not have to ask to have it turned back on. We have an ongoing maintenance contract with Maine, however they ware switching to another vendor sometime in 2025 and there are no additional CR's on deck that they will need to test.
What ever is easier, will work.

NM set up a Notification schedule for Filing Cycle notifications to go out to filers 6 days after the registration/renewal period begins. It is generating far more notifications than expected including apparent duplicates of nearly all recipients and inclusion of persons no longer associated to a filer as recipients for that filer.

Login to Lobbyist module.
Create/modify a Notification Template in the Filing Cycle Notification schedule that is set to go out the day you are testing (X days after registration period begin where X accounts for weekends and holidays).
Ensure that the Filing cycle for which you want notifications sent is linked to the Filing Cycle Notification schedule.
Have a developer execute the store procedure that generates notifications.

Issue:
Currently the UI for Editing existing Precincts with splits is not displaying correctly. This allows the user to add Streets and Districts to Parent Precincts with existing splits, which should not be allowed. This is only happening with existing data, new manually added Precincts work fine
NOTE: This is visible in the IA CONV and SANDBOX environments and is expected in the TX ones too, but since TX does not have split precincts this cannot be tested
AC:
All existing split Precincts will display the correct UI so users can only add more split precincts and not be able to add Streets and Districts to the Parent Precinct
Parent Precincts with splits are able to have Streets and Districts added (This add button should not be present)

Current functionality: The Renew By Date (annual report due date) appears to be adding +1 year based on the system year, not based on the year that the annual report was due prior to the new filing. See examples below
Example 1 from filing in December, 2024 for renewal due 1/31/25 (renewal due date should update to 1/31/26):
Current functionality: The Renew By Date on the entity is not being updated when Annual Reports are filed (tested with and without changes)
Expected functionality: The Renew By Date should display the next Annual Report Due Date. So each time an annual report is filed, it should be moved to one year in the future of the existing Annual Report Due Date. This should apply to most entity types, but not General Partnerships, DBAs, or Business Trusts. General Partnerships, DBAs, and Business Trusts should be displayed from the Expiration Date. The Expiration Date for a General Partnership should be set to existing Expiration Date + 5 years, while the Expiration Date for a DBA or Business Trust should be set to the existing Expiration Date + 3 years.

Found the wrong data in the file.

Need assistance getting TEAM and County data in sync
From VOTEC:
ere in a file
recently submitted by Bexar County. The file that all these examples
ZjQcmQRYFpfptBannerStart
“I'm
attaching 2 spreadsheets with examples of the unit type not being
cleared/applied and event type 7 dates not being updated for SC90 voters
that were in a file recently submitted by Bexar County. The file that
all these examples were in is 015_20241218SYNC_RESEND1.TXT and it was
uploaded to TEAM on 12/18/2024 and the reference # for the upload was:
01213496.”
UNIT_TYPE_NOT_CLEARED_OR_APPLIED.xlsx:
There
are 10 voters in the spreadsheet. 5 of the voters have a UNIT TYPE in
TEAM but not in the County data and submitting these as an event type 99
with a null UNIT TYPE should have cleared that value from the TEAM
record. 5 of the voters do not have a UNIT TYPE in TEAM but have one in
the County data and submitting an event type 99 transaction should have
resulted in the County UNIT TYPE being applied to the TEAM record. One
thing to note is that when you review the audit history tab in TEAM all
10 voters show as having activity on 12/18/2024 which indicates that
the correction record was received, it just wasn't applied to or cleared
from the unit type field.
ET7_DATES_NOT_APPLIED_TO_FPCA.xlsx:
This
spreadsheet has 3 SC90 FPCA voters that were submitted as an event type
7 to correct a VALID FROM date mismatch between TEAM and VEMACS but
none of their VALID FROM dates were updated on the SC90 record.
Without
a way to update these fields these voters will continue to show as a
sync mismatch every time the County submits an offline voter sync file.
Data fix applied. this shouldn't happen again, as long as the county is uploading the correct data. We found that it was all from the data that was imported.

W20241204172121
Amy and I have tried to reject a work order for a DBA cancellation, but each time the rejection has not produced a rejection letter.
When Amy initially rejected the work order, for some reason, it reappeared in the queue as an unassigned filing
In regards to W20241212197943 (RC PLANET, INC.), it seems it was submitted on the customer end via the Submit a Paper Filing Option on the registration site. The work order was rejected due to the entity being administratively dissolved. In order for an Articles of Dissolution to be filed, the entity first needs to be reinstated and be in an active status. The rejection went through, but the rejection letter itself was blank.
I returned the rejected filing back to my queue to process it and reject it once more (This time, I selected one of the checkboxes). However, only the rejection reason that was checked appeared in the rejection letter. Everything else is still blank.

See the following updates from email sent by Ben on 12/27
Following
up on my message from Monday about Wayne County's CEB-13. CT pointed out a
minor change to the language, with I have included below (in yellow highlight).
Brad pointed out the language should say, "17th Judicial Circuit"
instead of "17th Judicial Court". Both Co-Director's have reviewed
and approved the change and for Civix to push the change when able.
After the 2022 General Election, it was discovered that the Judge
of the Wayne County Circuit Court, 17th Judicial
Circuit
results were tallied by the County Election Board but were not
certified and included within this CEB-13 Form, that was
marked final on November 21, 2022. However, the results from the
2022 election are currently displayed on
Indianavoters.in.gov/ENRHistorical/ElectionResults.
The Wayne County Circuit Court, 17th Judicial
Circuit
office will remain in accordance
with the 6-year term mandated by
Indiana State Law and be up for re-election beginning in 2028.
Please
let me know if you have any questions.

The system has an environment variable that expires authentication links after a set period of time. However, if the user does not authenticate within this time period and an admin user resends the authorization from the user administration page, the system send correspondence to the user with the expired link in the email.

NOTE
- Link expiration is set to 72 hours in the Environment Variables (variable name - "Expire Password"). It may be necessary to set that variable to a lower number to test with any new users created.

Update filing image for ASCI INC 6539949-0142
We need Civix to fix this one by making sure the approval stamp is on top of the icons, not under. This appears to be an issue when the filer submits the saved fillable PDF and does not print to PDF. Below is a screenshot and I also attached a copy of the finalized filing.
Note, it's ok if the stamp covers up the entity number on this one. There was a typo in the entity number and it is not correct, the entity name is correct.

Issue with Null fields in the ApplicationRequestType field
Email from client:
This data set
looks fine at first glance. But again, my concern is that there are so many
NULL fields in the ApplicationRequestType field. For regular absentees, they
must either choose WV or FPCA from the dropdown menu to proceed. I’m seeing
both of those options throughout the data, but not for each voter. My theory is
that for UOCAVA voters, the way the application was submitted to the voter is
not being recorded, and it should be. So we will need a ticket for that before
the next election.
One anomaly I’ve noted so far is for Cabell
voter 000108614. The Excel sheet shows that the ballot returned via hand
delivery. However, the UI indicates that it was returned online. I spot checked
others, and this is the only one I’ve found so far that does not match the UI.
But this still gives me pause over the accuracy.
This issue will need to be addressed via a user story, not a bug

Is there anything on our end that we can do or would this need to be fixed by county jury vendor??
Kendall County:
The county is having difficulty transferring/downloading the jury wheel data to their vendor, Tyler Tech, because
“their system auto rejects the sequence of character’s that equals -{null}
.
It gives an error message that the Column 'LastName' does not allow
nulls. As fate would have it there is a Juror whose middle name is
Null.
This is the way the voter appears on the text file. I have attached the zip.
Their vendor is stating that this would have to be corrected on our end.
Sent to Julia -
We can't change the middle name of the voter; and the file format is what it is. They will need to sort this on their end.

I do not believe the system should be automatically sending out email correspondence to both clients and lobbyist. We should stop these before it becomes a bigger problem.
Lobbyist did not try to renew his former client "Emory" for 2025. They were terminated in 06/01/2024 and did not click the box on their renew form to renew with this client for 2025. So, the system should not be generating a client authorization request when the lobbyist does not request authorization during a renewal; just because the client is on their 2024 list as terminated.

The page will refresh and the UNFILED Committee January Quarterly Report Starting 12/11/2024 Ending 12/31/2024, Due 1/15/2025. Should show as unfiled, Notice it is only showing 3 transactions.
Then Switch back to the Home Page, (Select Home from the left menu) - That same report is showing under the Immediate to Do list and only showing three transactions as well. 2 Unfiled Expenditures and 1 Unfiled Return Contribution.
When I click to PREVIEW the Report from the Immediate To Do List or from the Unfiled Reports page, The report on the Summary Page is picking up
$1,288.0 in Contributions, and $61.90 in Expenditures. (Report Preview File is attached)
The Unfiled Contribution showing on the Contribution page total $1323.00 and the Unfiled Expenditures showing on the Expenditure page total $61.90.
The Detail on the Report Shows something different than the Summary page.
Schedule A shows a Returned Contribution of ($35.00) on 12/20/2024.
Schedule B-1 shows a total of $61.90 so it matches.
I don't see an UNFILED Contribution Return in the transactions on the system.
The report is leaving off the
Monetary (Itemized)
transactions as well as the Monetary (Unitemized).
The Report Preview, the Contributions/Expenditures grids, and the Reporting Activity are all showing part of the picture, but not everything. I'm also puzzled by the return Contribution that is showing on the report preview, but not on the Contributions page.
Only Contributions are showing on the Reporting Activity Grid. It's missing the expenditure.

For the 12/30/2024 deposit, # 25C0000190, the total amount of the deposit, based on the batches that were added to it, was $2,431 but the deposit allocation amount displayed, $2,444. The additional $13 came from WO #
W20241203170786. The first $13 was already deposited, but the additional $5 was added on 12/30.
I believe the batch ID is being removed from the already deposited amount so that the total for the WO is being pulled into the deposit report.

We have a
SERIOUS
and
SIGNIFICANT
PRIORITY 1
issue with the SFI system that
MUST
be addressed
ASAP
. It involves the system failing to make the necessary redactions to the public version of electronically filed SFIs.
This has resulted in the release of home addresses of filers which is information protected by law from disclosure
.
We are currently aware of two issues.
ISSUE 1
:
Question 30
Question 30
on the CY 2023 SFI asks the following:
Identify all mortgages, including home equity or reverse mortgage loans, OTHER than any mortgage on your Primary Residence, on which more than $1,000 was owed as of December 31, 2023, which you are obligated to pay and where the creditor (person who loaned you the money) is NOT by blood or marriage, your parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, child, grandchild, great-grandchild, aunt, uncle, sister, brother, niece, nephew, or the spouse of any such relative, and provide the required information for each.
Question 30.b
on the electronic form is what we refer to as the “redaction question.”
Question 30.b
asks:
Do you or any of your family members reside at this address?
If a filer answers “Yes” to
Question 30.b,
the system is supposed to redact the address provided. For some reason, that did NOT happen for 2 filers:
Senator Michael Moore
; and
Senator Bruce Tarr
. Based on our quick spot check this morning, it also seems to have happened to other filers.
It is
IMPERATIVE
that we figure out what is happening ASAP and fix it as needed.
We need Civix to provide us answers to the following questions.
Can you determine whether those two filers (Michael Moore; Bruce Tarr) actually saw
Question 30.b
when completing their CY 2023 SFI electronically?
2. If the two filers did
NOT
see
Question 30.b
, why did they not see it?
3. If the two filers did see
Question 30.b
, how did they answer it – Yes or No?
4. If either one or both of the two filers answered “Yes,” why was the address not redacted from the public view of their SFI?
ISSUE 2
:
Question 13
Question 13
on the CY 2023 SFI asks the following:
Identify all Real Estate in Massachusetts which you owned directly or through a Business as of December 31, 2023, and which had an assessed value greater than $1,000, and provide the required information for each Real Estate holding.
When viewing the Maintain Filing Questions tab in the SFI system, we are
UNABLE
to locate the redaction question – “Do you or any of your family members reside at this address.” which should be there.
It is
IMPERATIVE
that we figure out what is happening ASAP and fix it as needed.
We need Civix to provide us answers to the following questions.
Can you determine what happened to the redaction question for
Question 13
?
2. Are filers seeing the redaction question for
Question 13
?
3. If they are not seeing the redaction question in
Question 13,
why not?
4. If they are not seeking the redaction question in
Question 13
, why is the home address of some filers listed in
Question 13
actually redacted. We did a quick spot check today and saw that for some filers it was redacted (David A. Wilson) but for the two filers (Michael Moore; Bruce Tarr) it was not.

I've created the 2025 Prince George's Special Election in CRIS, but I am unable to assign the election participation to existing committees. Currently, it can only be assigned to committees that are registering. When I go to an existing committee and select the election type drop down the only option is Gubernatorial.
https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/1186872227/pulses/8146089368
Modified MD's stored procedure that fills in election participation dropdown to properly show the "prince george's" special election.

As an SVRS user
I want to know why the data in the file does not match what is displayed in the svrs UI
So that I can determine which one is correct for the EAVS survey data
AC: Investigate the cause of the discrepancy and correct it
Notes from WV:
T
he attached voter's data in the file "VOTER CHANGE AUDITs within 10_18_2022 and 10_15_2024.xlsx" does not match what is displayed on the UI. It is showing the timestamp on the same day for being cancelled due to inactive 2 federal elections and a duplicate merge in the file. What is causing this discrepancy?
The change audit file is also still missing transactions on 10-15-2024. We need to provide totals for transactions that occurred on or after 10/18/2024 and on or before 10/15/2024.
No data fix needed

Hi
@Fadwa Toumi Toumi Ben Chekroun
-
As discussed, it's working as expected. Please re-test the scenarios by assigning polling locations to an election on the "Polling Place and Precinct" screen. You should then see the data in the Schedule screen.

Client is separating out reporting periods for Employers and Non-Compensated Lobbyists. A new set of templates was created and a new filing cycle entered generating new reporting periods for Non-Compensated Lobbyists. Any attempt to modify a reporting period begin date, end date or due date results in the system stating that reporting periods cannot overlap.

email from Missi Kinder -
Users have reported SLOW system performance. They have a filing do on the 15th and are concerned, users are already complaining.

On the below 3 work orders in production, the filing image was not attached to the rejection letter - need to figure out why, and correct whatever caused this to not work as expected:
12106133-0160 DEVORE HOLDINGS, LLC (W20250106272106) - LLC RA Resignation
12455725-0160 TIMPVIEW ASC, LLC (W20241220227051) - LLC Statement/Articles of Merger
12651815-0151 HANCEY'S BEAUTY SALON (W20250106272134) - DBA RA Resignation
Update from client: It's happening on all rejections, not just the above - those were just the first 3 examples they provided. These are working as expected in QA and UAT, only an issue in production.
New update from client: This appears to be happening with work orders where the application was scanned. If the application was uploaded as a PDF file, it appears with the rejection letter when the work order is rejected.

Remove the unprocessed transaction from this work order: W20241206182004
Or just update it to Approved if that's easier, b/c the other transaction in the work order was approved, and they accidentally added it as a second transaction instead of updating the existing transaction.
mandeep updated the duplicate transaction to a status of void, so it's no longer showing in the work queue.

Transactions that have been entered for the 2024 January Quarterly Report.
21 Contributions for the January 15th Report
0 Expenditures
0 Loans
O Debts
for the 2024 Committee January Quarterly.
PREVIEW the Report - The Report is only picking up 1 Contribution on Schedule A-1 (In-Kind) dated 12/31/2024 for $3,750.00.
There is not a Schedule A,
Total for Schedule A should be. $1082.00 - Which matches the total on the Summary Page, the transactions just aren't on Schedule A. Schedule A is missing.
Since there aren't any Expenditures, the preview does not have a Schedule B and that is correct.
All totals on the Summary Page including the In-Kind Contributions are correct. (Schedule A-1).
Report Preview is attached
.
Reporting Activity - Is correctly displaying all of the Contributions. It is not displaying the In-Kind transaction and that is correct. It is showing a Carryover Balance of $31,846.52, which is the ending balance of the last report filed, the
2024 - 42-Day Post-General Report, so that is correct as well.
The Immediate To Do list on the Committee Home Page, is only showing 1 Unfiled Contribution on the Initial line.
However when you click on that link, and the page opens it is displaying all of the Contributions.
This information is also being displayed the same on the View/Filed Reports - Unfiled Reports page.
From the Admin Page, the Summary Information, under the Account Status is missing the Ending Balance from the last filed report, but correctly showing the Unfiled Contributions. The Unfiled In-Kind is showing $0 and that should be
$3,750.00, so its incorrect as well.
The Report Filing Page looks like this.
https://mainecampaignfinance.com/registrant.html#/dashboard/reportDisclosure
The total for Receipts, Cash Contributions (20) shows the correct number of transactions, but the total is showing as $0.00.
However the correct $ amount is being added to the Cash Balance at Beginning of Period, and the Correct Cash Balance at End of Period is also Correct, as well as the In-Kind total.
When you click on the caret, it opens the Pending Transactions grid, and all the transactions are being displayed there.
This committee Imported their file as well.
20 Transactions were imported w/o errors. 20 transactions were created.
Resolved issue with erroneous election assignment. Fixed transaction data.

In DAD LRS

2) Select the 2025 Lobby report schedule for principals
3) Select the vertical ellipsis
4) Note the bulk assign function is missing.
Expected - For principal cycles that have predecessor cycles, we should be able to "bulk assign" the next cycle (in this example assign 2025 cycle since 2024 cycle exists)
Actual - option to bulk assign is missing.

We need to see if there's a release code in the system for the name reservation code for Davis Vernal, LLC.
That name reservation got a 245 entity number, and the email was sent with no reservation code.
We also may need to do the same thing with these name reservations as we did with those other entities if all of these were sent without a name reservation code
mandeep provided release code, i checked in prod to make sure it worked, and provided it to the client.

Jesse comments
I worked on a CSS story (72775) but now have found a bug with my changes. Can you add a bug for me to correct the snackbar which now has white background around it, etc? This is only at the bottom of the page for the purposes of my testing and this screenshot as this really appears at the top of the page as it should.
EM > Polling Place > ADD/EDIT Polling Place
AC: remove the white background around the snackbar
I tested the removal of a CSS class which is natively used by Angular and which we also customized and it has reconciled the issue. To be clear, I only removed our custom expansion of the class, so it is still present but only with Angular defaults.

Hampshire County is requesting a list of inactive voters who have not participated in 2 federal general elections. Can you please provide this data? For now, just the voter name and voter ID should suffice.
The query should also ensure they have maintained inactive status throughout the two federal elections. Can we have a statewide list? It is time for counties to cancel these voters. Once they approve their lists, would you be able to write scripts to cancel for them?

Data has been fixed - next person to work on this needs to find and fix the root cause of the issue. See Parkers notes in the discussion for thoughts as to where the problem originated.
NM used the Bulk Assign Schedules in Prod on 1/10/25 to move the Employers to the 2025 filing cycle. Employers were properly assigned to the schedule, but their Lobbyists do not show as authorized for 2025. Further investigation shows that there are no entries in the LobbyistClients table for the Employer side for 2025 from the Bulk Assign process.
Updated usp_Common_BulkAssignementReportingPeriods to grab all lobbyists that are eligible from the previous year, as well as any that may have renewed already.

When adding a new election measure to the system, the "Ballot Measure Status Reason" field is not properly displaying or "popping out" as expected. This issue is preventing users from selecting or entering the status reason for a ballot measure, causing a disruption in the workflow.
Expected Behavior
:
The "Ballot Measure Status Reason" field should properly pop out and allow the user to interact with it, ensuring that the necessary data is input before proceeding.
Actual Behavior
:
The "Ballot Measure Status Reason" does not display, and users are unable to select or enter information in this field.
Navigate to the "Add Election Measure" section of the application.
Begin the process of adding a new election measure.
When prompted to select or input the "Ballot Measure Status Reason," observe that the field does not display, or is not interactive as expected.
Attempt to submit the measure without selecting a status reason, noting that it prevents the completion of the task.
The field was updated to function as a free-form text input, as per
@Geoff Sproat
guidance. This change has been implemented and verified. US #68829

Due to missing a step in the Bulk Assign Schedules process to add an entry into the LobbyistClients table for the Employer side of the Lobbyist/Employer relationship. registration packets generated for renewals into the 2025 filing cycle do not include Authorization Forms from the Employers for those Lobbyists with relationships with renewed/bulk assigned Employers. The Authorization forms should be included in the registration packets of both the Lobbyists and Employers where there is an on-going relationship.

These two entities are in production with the same name:
INNOFI AUTO FINANCE, LLC #14519596-0161 was registered 11/6/2024 inhouse
Innofi Auto Finance, LLC #14524763-0161 was registered 11/26/24 online
We need to identify why the system allowed the second one to be submitted after the first one. The inhouse work order (W20241118134201) was created in the system on 11/18/24. The online one (W20241126150104) was submitted 11/26/24. So the name should have been held from 11/18/24, but it appears that didn't happen (possibly the online filing was started prior to 11/18/24, but I don't see anything that indicates that in my research?)
**UT is also requesting that we run a query to identify any other duplicate (active) names in the system**
N/A - Issue occurred because the Name Hold feature was being developed and not deployed into the Production environment at the time the issue occurred. There were other duplicate names found due to "force acceptance" being used on the Inhouse review screen.

Entity
HANKS & PETERSON LAW PLLC (14531187-0160) needs the UTC Number changed from -0160 to -0162.
Subtype should be Professional LLC, and the Profession should be Attorney. I believe they can change the subtype in office correct, but I don't believe the profession is available to be updated via office correct, so we'll need to make that update as well.
Mandeep updated the UTC number and the profession. Cherie updated the filing image.

Issue:
When updating and adding additional roles to a user, it will create additional duplicated User records
AC:
When updating and adding additional roles to a user, the roles will be added successfully and no additional duplicated users will be created

Additional User is created
Before carrying out the resolution, the status of the bug was validated locally, it was shown that it worked correctly after several tests assigning different roles to a user and updating the role does not present duplicates in the user as required by the HU.

When logged in as a region-specific user, the system allows access to data from other regions

There is a typo in the drop-down when selecting 'Resources' within the role management area.

Lobbyist user John W Anderson cannot login. His user credentials appear to be conflated with another person - Debbie Schaefer as well as an invalid association of a Candidate and Treasurer linked to his Lobbyist registration. We need to confirm that the data in Prod matches that in QA (copy taken from Prod on 1/8/25 by
@Ben Pieper
) and if so resolve the situation.
Linked to Monday item:
https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/742061987/pulses/8195672178
There are three entities that I can see with john W Anderson:
A PAC - NM Bankers Assoc. PAC, Filer ID 1616. He is marked as the Treasurer with a username of JAnderson1616 and an email of DSchaefer@nmbankers.com.
A Lobbyist - John W Anderson, Filer ID 133987
An Employer - New Mexico Bankers Association. He is marked as the Authorizing Officer with a username of dschaefer@nmbankers.com and email of janderson@nmbankers.com. Debbie Schaefer is marked as custodian of records with an email address of dschaefer@nmbankers.com
In the users table in the system there are three entries that link to nmbankers.com email addresses and to the above entities:
Username JAnderson1616, links to the PAC with an email of DSchaefer@nmbankers.com. This matches the PAC.
Username janderson@nmbankers.com that is linked to the Lobbyist account with an email of janderson@nmbankers.com. This user account is not correctly linked to the most recent version of the member. We should roll back to the penultimate version of the member to correct this.
Username dschaefer@nmbankers.com that is linked to the Authorizing Officer of the Employer with Mr. Andersons name and email.
In addition to the above, we have an extraneous person record and an spurious member version of Mr. Anderson's Lobbyist record. On November 7 these error records were somehow added to the system.
To rectify the situation, I suggest that we do the following:
Remove the last version of the member record that added the extraneous person record.
Remove the extraneous person record.
Change all references to the dschaefer@nmbankers.com user account to refer to the janderson@nmbankers.com user account
Create a user record for Debbie Schaefer and make her a clerical user for the PAC, Lobbyist and Employer

A responsive design bug - related to using the zoom feature in the browser. Please note that the issue is appearing in the Chromium engine within the
Edge
and
Chrome
browsers, which I assume would both be the standard browsers supported by the application.
The crux of the issue is that button text is not scaling as it should. At 50% zoom, the text appears normal:
If I zoom anywhere beyond 50%, the text bleeds outside of the buttons. This will present a potential issue for users, especially those with sight accessibility needs.

It appears that when we added the Renew/Run for Office functionality for Candidates, we were not as selective as we should have been in adding the "Renew" button. This should NOT appear for PACs.

In DAD, when lobbyist renew, if they select to bring an auth principal forward, it brings that principal forward into 2025 as well.
Have a lobbyist and principal with an authorized relationship.
Have the lobbyist renew into the new year
Have lobbyist select to bring the principal relationship forward
After the renewal is complete, go view the principal amended registration "5% ownership field"
Check the db member table for "other explanation"
Note the data itself is null after the principal was brought forward on the amended registration version.
NOTE -
Will need a data cleanup task for this to basically bring forward the most recent non null "other explanation" value.
NOTE - Data on registration form when amended should never be dropping off unless it was designated by the filer during the amendment process ie lobbyist doesn't bring a principal forward or a user amends an optional field to remove their entry before saving an amend.
NOTE - for data cleanup, only users brought forward by lobbyist renewal and NOT bulk assign will need to be cleaned up.
Updated usp_Lobbyist_RenewEmployerWithLobbyist with the correct information
also added a script to clean up any data that might have been messed up through recent renewals

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to view the signature for each voter in Fayette County
So that the correct signature is displayed
AC: Investigate why signatures from voters in other counties are appearing for Fayette county voters and resolve the issue
Notes from WV:
Please see the email below from Fayette County.
Fayette voter 100727371 is showing a signature for Jackson County voter 100709491:
There’s no way this could have been a clerical error, because Ariana Buckley has never been registered in Fayette, therefore the Fayette clerk’s office wouldn’t have any documentation/signature for her. I’m going to have Fayette correct the signature for their voter (100727371), but please let me know why this is happening. This is the second instance where this has happened.
Fayette discovered another instance where a voter’s signature does not match. Voter 001001619 Cynthia Ryan has a signature for Patricia E Gray. There is not a Patricia E. Gray in Fayette County, but I believe there is one in Berkeley County – 101009830
I advised her that she can scan in the corrected signature. But this continues to happen in Fayette.

They recently got the bill and started to amend it today with the updated amounts, but now its all messed up. They deleted the expenditures for all of the candidates instead of amending the amounts for each candidate. Now the system won’t let them add the candidates back in with the correct amounts. The drop down for candidates is showing everyone BUT the ones that were deleted.
Before I go and suggest anything to them, I’m looking for your guidance.
I
think
we should delete the entire IE. Create a new IE with the correct amounts, administratively check it in, and then have them file it so it shows up as timely filed. I
think
a new IE would generate the entire list of candidates. Thoughts?
Is there a better/smarter way to do this?
Thanks in advance for letting me know.
You should be able to delete the Amended IE that has not been filed.
So that should leave the original IE of $50,000.00. If you then delete it, it will remain, since it has already been filed, and an offset record will be added.
The problem you are having with re-entering the transaction is all candidates that were on the original Transaction are terminated now, that's why they are no longer appearing in the dropdown.
The event log shows that the first candidate on the list, Allison Hepler was terminated on 1.9.2025.
You can now either enter the Candidates, as Payee Type "Individual Payees" or reactivate the candidate's registration have them enter the transactions, then go back in and terminate the account again.
If you decide to update the Candidates you should do it from the Edit Committee Details section on the Administration Page,
don't
do an Amendment or Correction!
Once they have been added to the IE and it has been filed, then go back into the Committee Details, Edit, and update the Committee Status back to Terminated.

Civix team:
I’ve received three calls today regarding the same from below—candidates who filed campaign finance reports on time, but today received the below communication suggesting they are delinquent.
The folks I’ve spoken with are Gary Howell, Scot Heckert, and Secretary of State Kris Warner (new boss).
I believe this has been reported by Missi Kinder.
Summarizing the issues, (1) the letterhead still says “Mac Warner”, (2) these committees timely filed campaign finance reports yet received this notice, and (3) their account data records confirm timely filing.
I recall some legwork that had to be done to get 2025 and 2026 reports activated in the system. As a layperson, I imagine this is a symptom of that problem.
If this can be resolved quickly, that would be preferable. If it’s on our end or within our ability to fix, we would appreciate some guidance.
Lastly, is it possible to identify all candidates who received this communication but should not have, and send an exoneration email of sorts to ensure clarity on their lack of obligation to take further action and ease concerns with a civil penalty? I’m happy to draft it, just let me know.

So that the provisional ballots are correctly counted
AC: The number of provisional ballots issued and not counted should accurately be reflected in the AdHoc query
Notes from WV:
Please see the attached AdHoc query from Monongalia. This was done under Reports > Ad Hoc > VIEW_PROV_BALLOT > Add all criteria > Make the condition the 2024 General.
It indicates that there were 3,733 provisional ballots issued and 2,345 were NOT counted. Monongalia indicates based that this is not correct. They issued 444 provisional ballots – 341 counted and 103 NOT counted.
Please advise ASAP.

Example #1
Residential address should be: 2101 Kingsley Dr

Attached is the copy of the in-person application at DPS showing the address:
Example #2

Provided the info to Lily. State closed out the ticket.

Happening in production, can be replicated in other environments using the same zip code shown in the screenshot, or any other zip code that returns a dropdown in the City section.
On the review screen (for internal and online filings), the City in the Principal Office Address Mailing Address section is showing twice if the Zip Code returns a dropdown in the City section. This does not carry over to the entity information, and does not carry over to the stamped file copy. It's only an issue on the review screen.

Entity #14508210-0140 received articles of incorporation from us that are filled with code instead of their entity information. They need this to be corrected so that they can open a bank account and begin business.
replicated filing in qa so that i could generate an image. updated with information from entity in production, and added new image in office correct.

For entity 14526996-0151:
City on Principal Office Address needs updated to Holladay instead of Salt Lake City (office correct isn't working for this change - we have that documented in another bug)
updated in db

Happening in production - I believe this also can be replicated in QA, but right now, office correct isn't working in QA.
A record was updated via office correct, and the "Public View Correction" button was checked to make the office correction public. The system makes it public, but the image isn't generated on the public side (See screenshot). The image of the office correction details should be publicly available if marked as a public view correction.
fixed

I preview the image before clicking the gear and going in to work on it. When previewing the application you can see it is a full document, however once you click on the gear to work on the application the filing image changes to be cut off. I have no idea how this happens. *The images are examples for W20250102260460*
image was scanned in sideways. i gave them direction for how to deal with these in the future, and corrected the file stamp to be in the right spot

Some (very few) work orders are coming into production as expedited that should not be. Application for Reinstatement filings for Domestic Business Corporations and Domestic Nonprofit Corporations and Withdrawal of a Foreign Profit/Non-Profit Corporation filings for Foreign Business Corporations and Business Nonprofit Corporations are not allowed to be expedited, but somehow there are a few in the queue that came in through the Submit a Paper Filing option that are showing up as expedited.
I've been unable to replicate this in the lower environment, as whenever I check the expedite box for these fillings, it still doesn't come into the queue as expedited.
Two requests here:
Ensure that
Application for Reinstatement filings for Domestic Business Corporations and Domestic Nonprofit Corporations or Withdrawal of a Foreign Profit/Non-Profit Corporation filings for Foreign Business Corporations and Business Nonprofit Corporations do not come into the work queue with a two day expedite/due date
Update the Submit a Paper Filing page, so that the expedite checkbox is disabled for the following filing types, so users can't even select it and therefore
think
it's being expedited when it's not
Application for Reinstatement: Domestic Business Corporation
Application for Reinstatement: Domestic Nonprofit Corporation
Application for Withdrawal of a Foreign Profit/Non-Profit Corporation: Foreign Business Corporation
Application for Withdrawal of a Foreign Profit/Non-Profit Corporation: Foreign Nonprofit Corporation
bug fix

This has been reported by a couple different users. I've been unable to replicated it in a lower environment.
W20250114301926: Certificate of Organization for D-LLC
I have had a few rejection letters of filing submitted via the submit a paper filing option appear blank. I typed the reason "must add position of member, manager, or governing person for the principal under section 5" in the box and the rejection letter is blank. I have copied links in other rejections which I'm pretty sure had numbers in them but that is the only thing I can think of that would cause this letter to not generate anything on it.

Notes from WV:
Voter 100999601 cast a ballot in Harrison County for the 2024 General, but moved to Monongalia County before Harrison could enter her participation history. Can we please have this voter’s participation updated to reflect that they voted a regular ballot in precinct 129C?

As an SVRS user
I want to have the data corrected for a voter
So that the information correctly reflects the county they reside in
AC: Update the highlighted information below for voter
000823981
Notes from WV:
When correcting a duplicate, Ritchie County had to manually enter previous participation history for voter 000823981. Therefore, it now appears that this voter voted in Ritchie instead of Doddridge, where they formerly resided. Can we please have the highlighted fields below changed?
The county should read Doddridge. Elections dating from 2016-2020 should be precinct 308, and the 2022 General should be precinct 20. Please only change the information highlighted – the other election dates and counties can remain as Ritchie.

New Mexico Legacy's dev deployment's seem to be failing. I did a fresh run of the build pipeline here:

Which looks to have completed, but changes are not actually being deployed. The most recent build published is from July of last year. In the "Call PreDeploy Driver" and "Call Deploy Driver" stages, there are errors throughout that appear to be related to access issues (file in use).

The Maine Conservation Voters Action Fund PAC originally filed a pending IE on time.
They recently got the bill and started to amend it today with the updated amounts, but now its all messed up. They deleted the expenditures for all of the candidates instead of amending the amounts for each candidate. Now the system won’t let them add the candidates back in with the correct amounts. The drop down for candidates is showing everyone BUT the ones that were deleted.
Before I go and suggest anything to them, I’m looking for your guidance.
I
think
we should delete the entire IE. Create a new IE with the correct amounts, administratively check it in, and then have them file it so it shows up as timely filed. I
think
a new IE would generate the entire list of candidates. Thoughts?
Is there a better/smarter way to do this?
Thanks in advance for letting me know.

I was able to assign the special election filing schedule to the two PACs that indicated they are participating.
However, I am not able to upload the regular 2025 filing schedule. This must have something to do with the issue earlier this week. When I attempt to assign filing schedules only one PAC shows up on the list.
All of the active ones, but try the House Democratic Campaign Committee. When I go to the specific PAC, the option to add the election cycle is there, but the Admin side (see list below) only shows the one available.
Other PACs you can try: Defend our Health; Senate Democratic Campaign Committee; The House Republican Fund, Dinner Table Action
This was corrected by removing the committee filing calendar entries that had been assigned.

When the Unknown Residence Address checkbox is selected on the voter registration screen, all the address fields (such as Street Name, Street Number, etc.) are populated with data. These fields appear to be editable but cannot actually be edited.
Navigate to the voter registration screen.
Check the Unknown Residence Address checkbox.
Observe that the address fields (Street Name, Street Number, City, State, etc.) are populated with data.
Attempt to edit the populated fields.
Notice that while the fields look editable, no changes can be made to the values.
Expected Behavior
When the Unknown Residence Address checkbox is selected, the address fields should either:
Be populated with default values but remain non-editable and visually indicated as such (e.g., grayed out).
Be left empty if the fields are intended to remain non-editable.
Actual Behavior
The address fields are populated with data when Unknown Residence Address is checked, but these fields look editable (they are not grayed out or disabled), leading to user confusion. However, users are unable to modify any of the data in these fields.
Now we have disabled the proper fields when Unknown Residence Address is checked.

Trying to delete Transactions "Other Receipts".
When navigating to the Other Receipts page, there is an immediate Error at the top of the page.
Unable to Delete transactions. When you click on Delete, you are take to the Receipt History page with no transactions displayed. The transactions display initially when you enter the page, but when you click to delete, you get a page without transactions.
Seems to be working for other PAC's. Same type of Transaction "Other Receipt" where the Receipt Source is a Group/Business/Corporation. Electric Cooperatives of Alabama seems to have several. The page displays correctly, and I am able to click Delete on the transaction link, without any issues.
The problem was caused by a transaction without an amount (not sure how that happened). After Lisa checked with the client, I have deleted the transaction and the page is loading without error now.
The script used for the delete is:

Sandra Shelton renewed her lobbyist registration this morning. It shows an entry in her event log that the renewal was submitted.
She has not shown up in the pending registrations and there is currently a “Renew Registration“ button available on her home screen. I have never known this to happen before.
We are going to ask her to re-submit, but this could get muddy if the original renewal shows up eventually and we are not able to delete one of them?
I ask them to hold off if they could on having her re-submitt her renewal.
Her ID # is 8283.
OK Admin had the user resubmit her renewal. Everything looks good now. Closing this ticket.

YES this should be capitalized

Same As Residential Address
.
Yes, I see what you are saying, the Domestic address radio button when selected shows the residence address. This is misleading.
When this is selected, the content changes to match the residential address, and is still grayed out. If I uncheck the box, I am suddenly able to edit the information. This behavior remains consistent
after
that option has been selected. It grays on selection and becomes active when unselected. My confusion is why it doesn’t behave that way until the user selects the option?
Capitalize the Ballot type* ('T' should be capitalized)
2. Attach the video when Same as Residential address checkbox is unchecked and when click on Domestic Address Radio the Residential address is being displayed instead of allowing the user to add new address.

Find all entities that have filed an annual report since going live, but their Last Renewed Date is not displaying correctly, and update Last Renewed Date to display Effective Date of most recently filed Annual Report.
In the below example, entity 13107795-0160 displays a last renewed date of 10/4/23, but should display 9/17/24.

Formation Date and File Date on entity show 01/03/2025, but the Formation Effective Date is 01/02/2025.
The work order (W20250102263877) was submitted on 1/2/25 at 8:51 PM, so the Formation Date and File Date should have also been set to 1/2/25. So the Formation Effective Date here is correct, but Formation Date and File Date are pulling incorrectly.
We need to fix whatever caused this, and also find all entities that are like this and update the Formation Date and File Date to be correct, based on when the filing was received.

CFIS Filer Monica Youngblood (ID 1564) amended a report on 11/29/24. The event log shows that at the same date/time as that report was filed, her status was changed from inactive to active. The implication is that she marked the report as her final report, inactivating her account. However, at the time, and still currently, she had $10,000 in outstanding fines. This should have prevented her from making herself inactive.
In QA, I reset her to active status, unfiled the report filed on 11/29/24 and attempted to refile the report and mark it as a final report inactivating the account. I was not able to inactivate the account in this manner. We need to investigate how the account was inactivated and close the loophole that allowed this to occur.

Regeneration of reports, whether from auto-amending after amending an earlier report or from doing a manual regeneration, is stopping in certain cases when a Statement of No Activity filed after an amended report is encountered.

Actual Results:

Figure 1: Result of registration renewal
The issue was caused by the system not correctly assigning the "Compensated" status during Lobbyist renewal. This happened because a key piece of logic that checked for active employers was previously commented out.
Fix implemented
:
✅ Restored the employer validation logic to correctly determine if a Lobbyist should be "Compensated".
✅ Ensured that the ElectionCycle assignment remains unaffected by this change.
✅ Prevented potential issues by verifying

Caldwell district clerk's office, in error, marked a voter as a
non-US citizen instead of a non-county resident. They attempted to fix

reason for exemption on the Juror status.
However, the record still shows a non-citizen alert for the voter even though it was already corrected on the jury end.
Is
there a way y'all can remove the non-citizen flag off this voter, as
county is unable to remove it without putting it on the voter record?

This issue affects multiple filers and likely all filers who have been assigned to multiple election cycles and have one or more amended reports. The Filings tab on the public page for the filers is not always showing the same set of versions for amended reports as the internal reports page. Reproducible in Prod, UAT, & QA though may affect filers slightly differently in each due to data differences with regards to what reports have been filed and amended.
Note
- This will not show up for a filer that has only been assigned to a single election cycle.
Prod, UAT, or QA
Search for filer on public site. Use any of these:
Filer #1648, 1651, 1653, 1657, 1658, 1659, 1664, 1670, 1671, 1672, 1673, 1675, 1680, 1683, 1686
Go to Filings tab
Change Election Cycle dropdown to "ALL" (issue shows up without changing dropdown, but this makes it easier to observe)
Find a report that has been amended.
Note the name and cycle of the report.
Expand the carat to show the prior versions
Log into the application
Work on Behalf of the filer chosen in step 1
Go to Reports
Select the amended report from step 4
Expand the carat to show prior versions
Expected Results:
The number of prior versions of the reports shown on the public site should exactly match the number of prior versions show in the filers workspace
Actual Results:
The public site available reports show a different version count compared to the internal Filing. For example, the public site displays two version, while the internal system shows four.
Figure 1 - Number of elections cycles - Note there are 4 election cycles
Figure 2: Filer workspace reports - Note there are three prior versions of the report
Figure 3: Public site filings tab - Note there are 1 prior versions.
The issue with amended reports displaying multiple times on the public site has been resolved. The public view now matches the private view, ensuring that only the relevant amended reports are displayed based on the specific year. Additionally, the anchor tag for report names has been reinstated to allow users to access all saved PDF versions of the filed reports.

As an SVRS user
I want to have a street's name edited
So that Harrison county has the correct street information
AC:
Notes from WV:
Some street corrections need made in Harrison County. Currently, there are two roads related to Nutter(s) Run Rd in Nutter Fort – one spelled correctly, and one spelled incorrectly.
INCORRECT: (No S)
CORRECT: (With an S)
We need all voters currently on Nutter Run Rd (Nutter Fort) moved to Nutter
s
Run Rd. (Nutter Fort) with an S. They should all be in precinct 102, combo 17. Further, we will need to remove Nutter Run Rd. (incorrect spelling) removed once all voters are placed on the correct street. Can this be done can quickly be done on the county end, or will it require a backend fix? They have two voters on this street that they need to register, so we are hoping to have this resolved quickly. Just let me know if you have questions or if more information is needed.

VOTEC - Need assistance with expired FPCA voters for 2024
Tim,
Please provide an update so Votec can address the below report.
Thanks,
Lily
Subject:
Need assistance with expired FPCA voters for 2024
Hi Lillian,
When
processing the FPCA SC90 expiration files earlier this month a
transaction was transmitted for some records that may have reflagged
them again as an SC90 FPCA in the TEAM system, even though these are
applications from 2024.
This showed up when Webb County submitted an offline voter sync file and voters were returned as an "Error Code 1.
Voter In TEAM, not in County" because their SC90 records were expired in the county system but existed in TEAM.
My
thought to address this is to resend them to TEAM with a Cancel Reason
75 "Expired FPCA" but I'm not sure a Cancel 75 can be submitted in an
import file. Also, when we created an FPCA voter list in TEAM for Webb
County the status of these voters in the report is listed as "F-75"
which may indicate some special state on the TEAM side.
So before continuing I wanted to check with you to get your thoughts on how to proceed.
Some sample voters in this state are:
SC90 VUID LASTNAME FIRSTNAME MIDDLENAME STATUS REGDATE
2215231853 ALONSO JOSHUA F 9/24/2024
2214657419 ALI SHAZA F 9/16/2024
2217175755 ALI NOOR JINAN F 10/15/2024
@Tim Endruschat
@Sean Fahey
I would like to correct these as soon as possible
so please reach out if you need more information or need anything from me to get this completed.
Data fix attached

It looks like the 2024 General Report did not get auto amended when they Amended the 2024 3rd Quarter Report.
I can have a developer force the Auto Amendment of the 2024 General, and the 2024 4
th
Quarter Report. Since the 4
th
Quarter Report is starting with the ending balance of the 2024 3
rd
Quarter Report instead of the 2024 General Report.
This one was not a case of auto amend not functioning correctly. Instead, it was a case of a report getting checked in and then the previous report amended before the checked in report was filed. After discussing with Lisa, I went ahead and performed a manual auto amend on the 2024 General Report and the 2024 4th Quarter report.

When adding an election measure, the
District Type
and
Districts
tabs fail to display the dropdown options. This issue occurs across all three environments (IA, TX, and QA Base).
Expected Result:
Dropdown options for District Type and Districts should be displayed when adding an election measure.
Actual Result:
The dropdowns for District Type and Districts are not displayed.
Navigate to the Election Management module.
Select Manage Election Measures.
Click Add Election Measure.
Attempt to select options from the District Type and Districts dropdowns.
As per my discussion with
@Kevin Villatoro
. The issue is not a bug but is functioning as designed. The visibility of the District Type and Districts tabs depends on the selected election having districts assigned. If districts are assigned to the election, the tabs will display as expected. No further action is required.

Lobbyist Matt Munoz (ID 559476) has added 4 Employers on his registration. Two of those have authorized him, two have not. None show as Authorized on the Lobbyist dashboard, the Employer dashboard or the public sites for any of the parties involved. Looking at the LobbyistClients table there are a number of entries where the LobbyistClientID (part of the primary key) matches the ClientID field which is the Member ID of the Lobbyist. This should not be happening and seems to be causing the problems seen for this Lobbyist and potentially for others.
Need to investigate and resolve this issue.

Issue:
There is no validation for odd or even street sides when adding or updating a street segment e.g. Side can be "Odd" and then have a low and high range of 2-10
AC:
Add validation so that in order to add or update a street segment the low and high ranges must match the side chosen, if not the street segment will not be added or updated and the user will receive an error message e.g. "Low and High Range values must meet street Side type"
NOTE: See the attached video for more info

After running Bulk Assign for the Lobbying Advertising Campaign 2025 filing cycle new versions of the Principals are created in the Person table to match the new version of the LAC in the Member table. However, instead of displaying just the latest version of the Principal from the Person table, the internal dashboard Principal list and the public site Principal list are showing all versions.

From Dave:
For
MILLARD PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOUNDATION (ID: 23BSF10589)
I can’t figure out how to remove the
Amendment
Needed
on the Filing page under Filing History. It popped up and
then they filed an amendment and it won’t go away. I tried un-filing
everything and refiling and it still won’t go away.
Dave was satisfied with the explanation I gave him (see below in the discussion) and agreed that having the application open in two different browsers is probably what caused the bad data. He will remove the extraneous contribution record and discuss with the filer.

We need to update the status of the open transaction under work order W20241211193095 to Void.

*Attached the spreadsheets and advised them to go ahead and extend the due date since we have a backup of when this error occurred. *
State Rep. Kenneth Sweezey and all newly elected state Reps (1/1/2025 start date -
in red
) were added to the system as "New Filers" by the House of Reps Liaison, Madeleine Gearan on 1/3/2025 because she was unable to update their
Filer Type
from "Candidate" to "State Official". On 1/9/2025, I merged their Candidate and Filer profiles.
Yesterday, 1/27/2025, we opened the SFI system for 2024 filing, and filers were sent the system generated email with their
User Access Notification (UAN)
, but it appears that instead of receiving the UAN email, Rep. Sweezey received a
Notice of SFI Filing Obligations
. This filing obligation cannot be found on our
Notification Overview
- I searched under Sweezey and the Liaison's name as well.
The SFI filing deadline for all "Public Officials" is 5/27/2025
.
I ran a FY 2024 report on State Representatives, and you will see that all the
new
State Reps entered on 1/3/2025 (red highlight) have the 2/26/2025 deadline. The
existing
Reps as well as other Reps entered in January have the correct 5/27/2025 deadline (green highlight). There were also two other Reps whose deadlines were altogether different (blue highlight).
This raises several questions and issues:
Why was the Liaison unable to update the
Candidate
profiles to
Public Official
?
Why is the deadline on the filing notice 2/26/2025 instead of 5/27/2025?
Why did the system send the
SFI filing obligations
to Rep. Sweezey instead of the UAN notice?
Was the
Notice of SFI Filing Obligations
sent to all new Reps (red highlight)?
Why do the two filers have a different deadline?
Attached are all the notices and reports mentioned above.
We can manually extend the filing deadline for the new Reps (in red), as well as the two other Reps (in blue) to reflect the correct deadline, but I want to be sure that doing so will not affect your investigation into the issue.
Please advise.

When trying to open the image for filing number 250121181510B, it says file not found. It was an online submitted work order. Doing a work order search using that filing number returns no results, so I searched in the work queue and found the work order number. Searching that work order number also returns no results in the work order search.
Please let me know if there's something that can be fixed in the db, so that this all works as expected, or if I should use the migration environment to recreate this filing and use office correct to upload an image.

It appears they added CT Corporation System as an Unregistered Entity RA instead of selecting CRA existing in the system
Although I'm not even sure here exactly, b/c it seems weird they would type the address in all caps, but everything else in mixed case, so it also seems like maybe they
did
select the existing CRA, but something weird happened...?
When the entity was created, it has the correct RA Address, but displays the entity name as the RA Name, instead of the RA Name that was entered on the RA tab.

The system allows the deletion of a role even when it is currently assigned to a user. This may lead to inconsistencies in user permissions and access control.
Steps to Reproduce:
Log in to the system with admin credentials.
Navigate to the "User Management" section.
Assign a specific role (e.g., "Manager") to a user.
Navigate to the "Role Management" section.
Delete the assigned role.
Expected Result:
The system should prevent the deletion of a role if it is assigned to any user or prompt the admin to reassign/remove the role before deletion.
Actual Result:
The system allows the role to be deleted without any validation, even when it is still assigned to a user.

Update the data from the db

New Mexico made a change to the 2025 Filing cycles after Lobbyists had started to renew. This resulted in some Lobbyists being assigned a Filing cycle tat was correct at the time of renewal/assignment, but incorrect after the changes. Fixing the assignment through the front end results in duplicated Lobbyist/Employer relationships showing for the Employers and Lobbyists in their respective admin dashboards as well as on the public site.
Cleanup of this will require
Updating the affected Lobbyists to set them on the correct Filing Cycle.
Regenerating reporting assignments to get the correct reporting periods assigned to the affected lobbyist
Removing reporting assignments linked to the invalid filing cycle
Steps 1 & 3 will require back-end data cleanup scripts to update the Member and Registration tables (step 1) and CommitteeFilingCalendar table (step 3). Step 2 should be done with the front-end Regenerate Assignments functionality.
Sequence of events leading to this situation:
Employers/Non-Compensated Lobbyists Filing cycle (ElectionCycleID 3545) created on 11/22/24
Some Lobbyists renewed and were assigned this election cycle.
Cycle modified on 1/9/25 to be for Employers only
New Filing Cycle for Non-Compensated Lobbyists (ElectionCycleID 3548) created on 1/9/25
The Member.ElectionCycleID and Registration.MemberElectionCycleID fields need to be updated with the ElectionCycleID of 3548 for the most recent version of any individual Lobbyists (Member.LobbyistTypeCode = 'IL') assigned the ElectionCycleID 3545.

As an

I want to
Ensure an amendment can't be filed on a foreign inactive entity
Acceptance Criteria:
Fix inhouse and online foreign amendments, to ensure amendments cannot be filed on a foreign entity that's not in a status of Active or Pending. This should apply to the File on an Existing Business screen for online, and the
Existing Entity Search screen for inhouse.
Applies to amendments for the following entity types:
F-LLC
F-LP
F-LLP
F-LLLP
F-NP-Corp
F-Corp
F-LCA
We need to ensure this does not affect domestic entities from
#84039
(where domestic entities
can
file amendments on inactive entities)

We have conducted a preliminary review and wanted to send this information ASAP. We will let Travis county know that the Street files have been uploaded so they can review and inform their findings. They know we are mapping some of their districts.

Issue: To resolve the DMV file with no signatures, AK would like the most recent signature on file for any of the records from the DMVVoterRegFile-2025-01-07-20-30.xml file to be associated with the respective records
Notes from AK:
Here is how Phillip would like this to be handled.
Please associate the most recent signature on file for any of the records from this batch where there is an existing signature.
I imagine it being something where you grab the most recent GUID of the sig for that person and just putting in the new record sig slot…like I know what I’m talking about!
Obviously, if this is a new reg, then there won’t be an existing sig and staff will have to request, if necessary.

I reached out to DMV and they are questioning the file with no signatures:
can you provide a few records (Driver’s license number best – the AKDL field of the payload) of those missing signatures so we can check on them? We just spot checked the XML payloads from the past week or so and don’t see any missing signatures. Was it the whole batch for the day? What day(s)?

We've got a pack committee who has some changes that they've been making over the years to their committee members, but it's tapping out as far as letting them add new ones It's not allowing for new ones to be added because it says that they've reached their limit. Is there anything that we can do on this end to fix this, or is it something that has to be done administratively? We want it to be where committees can make the necessary changes, but it's just saying, I guess it's too many officers already listed even though some are inactive. But can you assist us with this? Will you call me back at 334-353-7150? At 334-353-7150? Thank you so much. Looking forward to hearing from you. Bye bye.

L3C appears to be identified as a distinguishable word, instead of as an indistinguishable entity indicator
Replication Steps:
Log in (inhouse or online)
Create a filing for a low-profit LLC (entity indicator L3C)
Complete the filing
Start a new filing for another entity type
Use the same name, but with the correct entity indicator for the new entity type
Current functionality: Name does not show up as a conflict
Expected functionality:
Name should show up as a conflict (
Since L3C is just the entity indicator, it should not be recognized as distinguishable)
Screenshot 1: See that if i use the name "cherie 020325 l3c", it's returned as a conflict
Screenshot 2: If it's the same name, but a different entity indicator, it's not being flagged as having a conflict

Setting up reporting periods, when you change or correct something, then search and filter again, sometimes the same results are not being presented, or it look like the change didn't take.

I want to only see ballot return information after a ballot is received
So that there is no confusion about a ballot being received
AC: Ballots in the absentee module should not show a "ballot received by" method if the ballot has not been received
Notes from WV:
I found that the Ballot Return Information in the absentee module is showing a “ballot received by” method, even though the ballot was never received. Here is an example from Marion – 000448949. The ballot is currently in the “requested” state, so there is no reason for there to be a return method.
Added default select option in the dropdown list

Initial call came in as IE, for the 2025 Special HD 40 Election did not add an IE Report.
The reason for this was the Threshold for that IE Report had not been set up.
Martha set up the IE thresholds for the 2-Day report, and also set up the IE Threshold for the 1 Day report both for the Special Election.
Then she called because the report wasn't added to the Committee's Unfiled Reports.
I then told her she would need to edit the IE (without changing any data) then resave the IE, and that would trigger the report.
Then she emailed, that the 2-Day IE Report wasn't appearing on the Unfiled Reports page, even after she had edited the transaction.
I looked at the Threshold Set-up for the 1 and 2 day IE Reports. They are correct.
The IE Report is NOT showing up on the Unfiled Reports page, but it is showing up on the Committee's Home Page, under the Immediate To Do.
While on the Reports page, I also noticed there are 2 ACTIVE Election Cycles.
1 for the 2025 Special Election, for PACs BQCs & Party Committees, and one for the 2025 Election.
These Election Cycles, have overlapping dates, I'm not sure how they got both of those Election Cycles active at the same time??? Anyway.. With both Election cycles, the system doesn't know what report to put the transaction on.
I sent instructions for Martha to Update the Begin Cycle Date of the 2025 PACs BQCs & Political Party Committee Cycle to the day after the end date of the 2025 PACs & State Party Committees or HD 24 Special Election.
If this doesn't work, I'm going to need some help. They are in a Reporting Period for the 2 day reports right now, so will need this working ASAP.
Fixed transactions that were erroneously linked to the wrong registration ID.

User is trying to file a reinstatement for entity 13181193-0142. The Name Change tab is showing a conflict with entity 14508451-0143 (Cora, Inc.). In researching, it looks like the domicile name for Cora, Inc. is Lyv Life, Inc., so that's why the system is throwing the conflict, but that entity should only be holding the name Cora, Inc. - not Lyv Life, Inc..
I did some testing in migration, and it appears that the assumed name (instead of domicile name) is being held now, so the root cause may be fixed here (but please double check to be sure of this).
I also tried to do a formation in production online for an entity called Cora, Inc. and it did return 14508451-0143 as a conflict, so it appears that entity
is
correctly holding Cora, Inc.
So the fix here is that we need to ensure
14508451-0143 is only holding Cora, Inc., and not
Lyv Life, Inc.

As an SVRS user
I want the following street edits to be made
So that Ohio county has the correct street information
AC:
Ohio County needs to edit a street segment on Glenwood Rd (Wheeling). If time allows, we’re hoping to get this completed as soon as possible, as there is additional street maintenance Ohio will be doing on their end in order to place voters in the proper precinct.
Currently:
All 264 –

Waller County:
This is the same situation that Waller County had previously with Possible Felons.
Waller is asking the record be removed as they are not registered in Waller and residence address is in Fort Bend.
Dashboard cleared.

Tested in QA Base, IA and TX :
Log in as a Region user
Go to Voter Management > Voter > Search
Locate the box to allow to search for Purged voters under the Voter Search screen filters
Actual Result: Box label reads:
"Searched Purged Users"
Expected Result: According to the US
https://dev.azure.com/CivixGovDevOps/SG/_workitems/edit/71887
this should read "Search Purged Voters".

This was reported in Prod and reproduced in QA with the filer reported by the client. Further reproduction may require selecting another Lobbyist for testing. Attached the registration PDF from Prod to the ticket.

Pay any unpaid fines from late reports
Exit Work on Behalf
Work on behalf of filer Michael Bowen - ID 129404
Click on the Registration Renewal button
Renew employment by PECOS VALLEY ARTESIAN CONSERVANCY DISTRICT as Compensated with fee paid by Lobbyist (Will be paying = yes)
Do not renew employment by any other employers
Respond Yes to the Harassment questions
submit the registration and pay the fee by check
Expected Results:
A filer assigned to the Compensated Lobbyist Filing cycle should be assigned 3 scheduled reports and have the File Unscheduled Report button available as they are also assigned the 48-hour report as an optional report should they need it.
Actual Results:
Filer has been assigned the 2025 Non-Compensated Lobbyist filing schedule (Figure 1)
Figure 1: Result of registration renewal
The issue was caused by the system not correctly assigning the "Compensated" status during Lobbyist renewal. This happened because a key piece of logic that checked for active employers was previously commented out.
Fix implemented
:
✅ Restored the employer validation logic to correctly determine if a Lobbyist should be "Compensated".
✅ Ensured that the ElectionCycle assignment remains unaffected by this change.
✅ Prevented potential issues by verifying
LobbyistEmployer
before iterating over it.
🚀
This fix will be monitored after deployment to ensure expected behavior.

Changes do not appear to have been made and behavior continues the same on this item. I created a registration for Jay Ray as shown below (4 registrations since I was not getting the notification that it was submitted). I then rejected all of them and attempted to create the registration again using the same information. This time, I kept clicking on submit but there was no error message, no notification that the registration was submitted and the screen didn't indicate any missing fields:

Issue 1
: Usually, it is not allowed to add duplicate town when add a new town to a given county from Add town page. but you can do so when try from Edit County page.
Issue 2
: When you add a town to a County from Edit County page, it allows to add a town from other county without any warning. Meaning you can move a town from one county to other county without any warning. There should be an alert so that user knows what county the town is moving from.
Issue 3

Investigated and resolved underlying issue. Created SQL script and attached to ticket.

From Customer:
I started out on this page, the fee starts out at $59.00, but as I progress through the pages, the fee went to $34,000.00. Then I deleted the filing.
If we were registered in the past, and I have to register again in the new sight, please tell me where I need to go. I am obviously doing something wrong.

Reports for CFIS filer Sarah Guzman (ID 2597) were manually regenerated by Julie on Feb 7 after we put in a fix for regenerating Statements of No Activity. Here first filed report had been amended after she had filed one of more Statements of No Activity. The regeneration process required adding the start and end balance from the Reports table to the RegenerateReports table and the ending balance of the first report from the Reports table did not correctly reflect the activity reported on that first report. Thus all subsequent reports were incorrect. Need to seed the RegenerateReports table with the correct data and regenerate all filed reports for this filer. Secondarily, we need to clearly document what the inputs are for manually regenerating reports in NM and what needs to be done to ensure that the data related to the starting report is correct.
In NM Prod environment
Login to the CFIS module
Work on Behalf of Sarah Guzman (ID 2597)
Go to the Reports Page
Select the Filed tab
Sort on Period End date
View the first filed report (First General Report for 2020, due on 9/14/20) .
Note the Beginning and Ending Balance for the report on the PDF and that the math taking into account beginning balance, contributions and expenditures results in a correct ending balance (Figure 1).
View the chronologically next filed report
Note that the Beginning balance does not match the Ending balance of the previous report.
In the database view the most recent version of the records in the Reports table for the Amended version of the First General report of 2020.
Expected Results:
The beginning and ending balances for the amended version of the first filed report for the filer should match the PDF.
The correct values for the first report to be regenerated should be seeded into the RegenerateReport table based on actual activity reported
Actual Results:
The beginning and ending balances for the amended version of the first filed report for the filer
do not
match the PDF.
The correct values for the first report to be regenerated
were not
seeded into the RegenerateReport table based on actual activity reported
Figure 1: Summary sheet from amended First General Report of 2020
The regenerated reports beginning and end balance are seeded from the original Reports table. In this case, the report still had the wrong ending balance, resulting in the regenerated report having the wrong end balance. After updating the Report table with the correct end balance, i was able to regenerate with accurate results.

This is a reopen from a previous ticket 83255 which had tucker county with inaccurate counts. The related ticket is linked in the related work section. Wetzel county now has inaccurate count on Early Voter Report. Attached is the PDF of the early voter report
AC:
The Total Voters by Poll Place count will be accurate.
Email: The Tucker County reported I viewed looks correct. However, looking at Wetzel, the grand total on page 259 is 1,799. On page 260, the total comes to 1797 (1796 + 1).
note: Previously I noticed an issue with voters that voted in another county and then moved to a different county, causing some issues. The logic seems to take the current county registration of the voter into the reports, rather than the current county poll place they voted in. So, if they voted in Barbour county and moved to Tucker county, they will show up in tucker county's early voting report with the Barbour county poll place, which increases the total count by that one voter.
There is, also 2 more voters in this report that is unaccounted for. Im wondering if it is the 2 cancelled voters that is causing this anomaly.
One early voter was marked as cancelled in January after the elections and the other voter was cancelled due to a duplicate record.
There are two queries existed 1 is main query to pull the records and second one is for sub report to do group by poll places. As part of fix I have changed sub report query to make everything same
After Fix executed same fix in PRODUCTION results are matching.

As an SVRS user
I want to see the audit history of a voter that was processed through the DMV file
So that no voter information is lost
AC:
Audit history missing from a DMV voter that was processed, please investigate the cause
AC: Audit history reflects "no change" even when no changes have been processed during change/registration.
Notes from WV:
Please see the email below from Monongalia County regarding voter 100908177. There is nothing in his audit history, nor is there any indicator of an address change under the Previous Name, Address & Status tab. I confirmed on the Voter Information tab that changes were, indeed, made today. But nothing is reflected on the audit history.
After processing a voter from the DMV queue today, I noticed the audit history doesn't show my entry. I believed the only information I changed was the address. The disposition letter does indicate this with the box being checked. This is the voter ID # 100908177. I cannot remember if audit history not being shown is a known issue. Any advice is appreciated, as always.
Its the actual Behavior as When you hit on change button it will add audit/change date but it will not add any audit record

When a Lobbyists adds an unregistered Employer to their registration, it is showing up on the Registration PDF, but not being displayed on the Lobbyist's dashboard list of Employers. This is leading to confusion.
The initial report was from a filer who amended their own registration to add an unregistered Employer. Needs to be tested as both a filer and as an admin working on behalf of the filer.

Issue Summary:
DPS Application on TEAM, the street box fields didn’t populate automatically.
Description of the Issue:
County is working this morning their DPS app on the dashboard.
Chanda reported that while she is working the DPS app the residence
street it should have populated automatically and its. The field
boxes are empty. They are having to enter search for the street

From VOTEC: Bexar is one of their clients.
Customers are
reporting that some of the DPS files that were posted today appear to
have a problem with the
block. The
following fields:
are
all combined in the
field in the .xml file so the
address was not parsed out correctly and our import is flagging them for
operator review because they can not be precincted.
Need to know once the correct files are posted.
Closed by the state.

From client:
The customer was logged into his account and tried to search his business name under Search > Business Entity. After entering the name and hitting search, his entire screen went blank. He tried searching it on another computer and experienced the same issue. He did this on Saturday, 02/08/2025. He wasn't sure, but he thought it was between 2-4 PM MT. He was searching for Majority 51, L.L.C. Unfortunately, when he shared his screen with me today, he did not experience this issue.
Was there a system outage to explain why his screen went blank on two different computers?
They want us to look at the logs and see if we can identify why he was having an issue searching for his entity.

Please let me know who signed the Annual Report filing for entity 8156697-0143 (filing number 241029045580B) - I just need the name and title of the signer, and I can fix the filing image.

Kevin Hornberger came into the office today to pay $80, but as per MD CRIS system, the amount is $535 because they filed the report on 9/13/24. The error is why he received the Show Cause notice letter for 8/27/24 Report for $80 and it says that the report was filed on 8/31/24 as per that letter.
Was there a report that was deleted then refiled?

The "additional documents" checklist item is duplicated for some Internal Review filings. I went in to the Rejection Queue Transaction Maintenance screen, and for the specific filing this was reported for (D-LLC Amendment), it's only displayed once. I disabled it - and it removed both items in the checklist. I added it back, and it added two back instead of just one.
I went in sometime in the last week or so and updated the rejection reason to say "The uploaded document is unacceptable, please remove and resubmit." instead of "Additional Documents / Provisions have been uploaded - verified that the document is acceptable.", and this seems to have been caused by that. However, I made the exact same changes in UAT, and UAT is not duplicating the checklist item.

Issue 1:

INTERNAT ONLY: High Numbers of DPS APPLICATIONS RECIEVED BELONGING TO OTHER COUNTIES Dashboard Activities - February
Tim,
Please
research. Counties stating they are receiving applications belonging to
other counties. Is this how they are being coded in the DPS App Files
or is there an issue with Smarty Streets as we discovered before.
CLARK EILEEN FAYE -Looks like the county pre populates.

County Name: GALVESTON
Date of Report:
2/13/25
Issue Summary:
Reports do not match in regards to total voters assigned to specific districts.
Description of the Issue:
County is a split county and the elections office assigned the
district U.S. Congress 14 to pull all the voters into their local
election. The reason they did that is because the county did not have
the Countywide district assigned to all streets. The voter
registration office then assigned all streets to the countywide
district. They noticed that the total of U.S. Congress 14 district
and Countywide district total did not match.
Details:
Below is the total of voters assigned to each district. The districts that the Voter registrar is asking about are as follows.
County states that all four districts should all match to 240,330.
She states that she assigned all the street to Countywide ALL, Court of Appeals, and Criminal district Attorney.
Preliminary Research Conducted:
Galveston
ran a voter list, street list, and district list to investigate why
there is a difference and what streets are missing the three other
districts.
Street List Report #001192689
is
for U.S. Congress 14. There is a total of 11,854 streets assigned
to that district. On the same report, I filtered out Countywide
district code ALL and there are no blanks meaning that district is
also assigned to all 11,854. To double check that is accurate, I
ran another street list report ID 00192693 that I selected for
CTY-ALL. Same result. The district is assigned to 11,854 streets as
well. Meaning that countywide district, court of appeals and criminal
district attorney should also have 240,330 voters but they don’t.
Another
street list report was ran to check if Countywide district was
NOT assigned to a street. The report came back with only two
streets not having that district assigned. Missing Streets and Out
of County Street. Which is correct.
On the
screenshot above it does show to be that there is a difference of
assigned precincts on the US Congress compared to the other three
districts.
Those precincts are 232.1; 419.1; 432.2; 480.1
I ran a
voter list report #001192787
and there was no data found. Meaning there are no assigned voters to those precincts.
Voter list report #001192727
is
filtered out to see if there are any blanks on the three other
districts. When the Countywide ALL district is filtered out, there
are blanks but there shouldn’t be because according to the street
report all four districts are assigned to all streets.
Here is an example. Column AZ for Countywide ALL was filtered for
blanks. Then I copy and pasted a VUID into TEAM voter inquiry. The
display of districts showcases that
INDEED
the district is assigned but the report is showing it isn’t.
THE MAIN CONCERN OF THE COUNTY IS THAT WHY IS IT SHOWING ON THE VOTER’S
STREET AND VOTER INQUIRY BUT NOT ON THE VOTER LIST REPORT AND WHEN
RUNNING THE DISTRICT LIST REPORT.

The below is in an example in regards to the Voter List report #
001192220
. Williamson County mentioned that the districts are showing “duplicate” on their report in column
AT, BC, BE, BF, AU
and
BA
.
When
looking at the individual voter record and at the street they show as
normal. The report seems to be the only location of the duplicates. Can
this be looked into?
Example VUID: 1150154376

Bexar County - 389 FPCAs to RE-EXPIRE & 1 voter sent to county 3,500 times
There are two items for Bexar County that need resolution:
1)
There
are still 389 FPCA voters from 2024 that were not expired when you
reran the expiration process for us at the end of January, and I've
attached a spreadsheet (BEXAR_2024_FPCA_VOTERS_TO_EXPIRE.xlsx) with a
list of the outstanding voters
.
Please RE – EXPIRED these FPCAs
2)
Voter
2174495852 - ALEXANDER RANIERI MORGAN is being included multiple times
in basically every VRU file that is posted for Bexar County. They were
cancelled on 08/31/2022 and so far their cancellation transaction has
been sent back to Bexar over 3,500 times so we're hoping to get this
stopped
. I've attached a spreadsheet
(MORGAN_VRU_FILE_COUNTS.xlsx) with the file names and number of times
they were included so you can confirm what we're seeing in the VRU
files.
Data fix applied.

Happening in production, replicated in migration (old entity: 10946545-0142, new entity: 10946545-0170)
Replication Steps:
Find an existing Active migrated entity
Create a filing for Articles/Statement of Conversion to a new entity type
Complete the Articles/Statement of Conversion filing
Go to the filing history on the newly created entity
Try to open one of the old filings (
not
the Articles/Statement of Conversion, but an older one)
Current functionality:
After a conversion filing, the filing history of the original entity is duplicated on the new entity, but the filing images are returning "
File not found." error when trying to open from the newly created entity (they do open fine on the converted/original entity)
Expected functionality: Filing images should be accessible from both the converted entity and the new entity

From Brittany:
The attached Kanawha voters were cancelled in error. Can you write a script to change their status back to Inactive? The username for the change audit may be CIVIXDATAFIX,
and
change the status change reason for the voters in Kanawha's list to "No Response to Confirmation"
instead of "No Activity
For 2 General Election Cycles," which would be for cancelled voters.
I have changed the status = Inactive, status reason =’ CONFIRMATION NOTICES’ & id user = CIVIXDATAFIX for the attached 218 voters.
data fix applied to prod.

As an SVRS user
I would like to be able to edit streets
So that I do not need to submit a data ticket to have streets corrected
AC: Implement the code fix as discussed with Brittany and Elaine below. Keep the backup in the Prod database and delete the orphaned streets
Notes from emails:
Thank you! I will keep the
backup in prod database and delete the streets! This will cut data tickets by
50%!

RE: street segment issues
Good morning,
Brittany/Elaine
For removing orphan streets,
I don’t think we need to ask counties. Because they don’t even know that the
street exists in the system since it is not visible for them.
Yes, I will keep the backup
in the database and will restore it anytime if needed.
I am pretty sure deleting
those streets will have no impact to users, and it was also tested in lower
environments, and we were waiting for the general election to end.
For example, I did this in
UAT FOR # 88610, Kanawha wanted to add OMI Lane:
I get, as any user, this
error:
Then, I deleted the street
in the and went back and refreshed the screen then the street successfully
created.
For the second item where we
need a code fix, I will work with my team to create a ticket, and we can wait
until the upcoming election ends.
Thanks,
Biruk Keraga

Biruk,
Yes, county users would like
to be able to handle these items on their end, as to not hold up the voter
registration process. I agree with your proposed solutions as long as your team
can confirm that the code change would not impact other elements of the system.
The first item regarding orphaned streets, though… Since it has been a while
since this was tested in a lower environment, can we re-test to ensure that all
runs smoothly?
Further – before a fix is put into place – I’d be interested in hearing a
response to Brittany’s last two questions.

Re: street segment issues
Hi Biruk,
I am good with
whatever Elaine thinks is best, since she has the most experience working with
counties on street segments in recent years. We would need assurance that the
code fix would not affect other functionalities since we have municipal
elections coming up.
Street segments
are maintained by the counties, so the state does not have knowledge that would
help us in a review of the orphaned streets. Do you believe it’s necessary to
ask the counties to review these? Would having a backup allow us to restore
them if something goes wrong?
Thank you,
Brittany

street segment issues
Hi Brittany / Elaine ,
As you know, most of data tickets these days revolve
around a street segment. Either creating a new segment or updating existing
street segments.
I think clerks would like to do such activities by
themselves rather than coming to us. There are two solutions for the two
problems:
There
are Orphan streets that are not linked to any street segments. Such
streets exist in the street library but have no associated street segment,
and are not visible to users in the application.
But when users try to create a street segment using those streets, they will
get error saying that the street segment already exists in the system.
So, the solution is just removing those streets. We
have tested this in lower system long time ago but haven’t yet pushed to prod.
I have attached list of orphan streets that needs
to be deleted, please review and approve the delete. (if you need, we can keep
the backup in the database to be safe)
The
application should allow users to update street segment if there is no
voter on the segment. I think we can even allow changes to high & low
values to existing street segment as far as the change doesn’t conflict
with existing voter on the segment.
Since I have been doing this for long as a data
fix, I don’t see any risk if a user can also make such changes through the
application. If you agree with this move, we will have a code fix.
Let me know if you have any question or concern.
Thanks,
Biruk Keraga

While testing the acceptance criteria for the "View" button functionality in the HAVA Grant Election Security Expenditures - County Name Page, I observed discrepancies in the action menu for listed invoices:
QA Base Environment: The action menu is completely missing for the listed invoices.
Texas QA Environment: The action menu exists but only includes Edit and Delete options, while the Add option is missing.
Expected Result:
The action menu should be present for listed invoices and should include Add, Edit, and Delete options as expected.
Actual Result:
In QA Base, the action menu is completely missing.
In Texas QA, the action menu exists but only includes Edit and Delete options, with Add missing.

The scope of the test is limited to verifying the "View" button functionality only. The button successfully navigates the user to the HAVA Grant Election Security Expenditures - County Name Page, fulfilling the acceptance criteria.

According to AC's from US:
#87300
, the placeholder for the indicated field should be
"Date Generated" instead of "Upload Date" in the Batch Print - After Generation screen:
The AC for the Date Generated filter was met with a different field during development. This bug will now be used to hide the Upload Date filter.
Log in as State/County user
Navigate to System Management > Notification
Select the Batch Print - After Generation option
Verify that Upload Date field is not shown.
Actual Result: The field is named: "Upload Field"
Expected Result: According to AC's name should be "Date Generated":
removed the date generated field

For work orders that are auto approved online, they're showing up in the Online Approved work queue, but the details of the filing are not showing as available when trying to review. Can these be fixed so that they display what was completed in the filing? (it seems like these are showing as inhouse filings instead of online?)

2024 4th Qtr Report filed by Joshua K Higginbotham ID 232811 was due on 1/7/2025, and it is not showing up in the Admin Quick Links, View Late Reports.
There was a request to remove the 2024 General Report, that had been filed, so I removed it, then they sent an email to disregard. I had already unfiled and removed the report.
I think we can still add it back, but that's not going to do anything to help get the 4th qtr report on the Late Filings list.

As an SVRS user
I want to have the totals match when doing reports with the same criteria
So that I know no voters or their information are being left out of the reports
AC: Investigate why the totals are not matching
These queries are not in SIT, they are available in UAT
Notes from WV:
When I generate a full participation query for the 2024 General and filter by the FL_CHALLENGED column to only include “Y,” There are 196 results – 195 ballots not counted, 1 ballot counted.
When I generate the provisional report, there are 2,352 ballots counted, and 1,388 not counted.
Both reports are attached.

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to delete the cancellation list
So that the voter information is less cluttered
AC: Correct the "delete list" function so that it removes the voters as expected
Notes from WV:
Preston County is unable to clean up their lists of cancelled voters under Voter Management > Voter Search Information > Cancellation. An example is Yiliana Rivas Gil under the “Authorized Cancellation” section. When they click “Delete List,” it asks the user if they are sure they would like to delete them, but once they click OK, nothing happens. She granted me permission to try and remove this particular voter from the queue on my end, and I see the same issue.
Can this function be corrected, or must these voters remain in the county queues?
Made changes according to code status reason No it will delete as per the code status reason

I want to have envelopes print for cancelled voters
So that batch print generates envelopes for the correct voters
AC: Investigate the cause of the envelopes not printing/the queue being incorrect and fix if possible
Notes from WV:

Further, duplicate cancellation letters are appearing in the batch print queue:

For entity 10803590-0143, I tried to add a filing to the filing history through office correct, and it isn't showing in filing history. The filing number generated is 250219002478B - can we see if there's an easy way for it to display in the filing history?
If there's an easy way to get this one specifically to work, I'll create a separate bug for it being just an office correct issue. If not, I'll update this bug to address the bigger issue instead of just this filing. Please just let me know.
mandeep fixed this entity, and i created
#91369
to address the root cause

I corrected a filing image for the Certificate of Assumed and of True Name for entity 14513162-0151, but the updated image isn't showing up now when trying to open the image. I tried twice and it still won't show up. If this is a quick fix, I have 4 other DBAs whose filing images need corrected and updated as well, and I'll create a new bug for the office correct issue. If it's not a quick fix, please let me know and I'll change this to fix the office correct issue.
this one worked today, so i'm removing this bug from the backlog

Happening in production, I haven't been able to replicate it.
The system seems to be adding comments to work order notes that aren't being added by users. This has happened twice now, and it appears to be when they reject a reinstatement for the tax commission saying they're not in good standing, then come back an add a new comment - it then is adding a "comment" from "Work Order Filing Popup" that's not what they added, and it seems to be pulling from that original rejection.

Street segment with no voters
"No results found" message is displaying when there are no voter registered to a street segment

AC: Research why it appears that the counted column is incorrect prior to the 2022 primary
Notes from WV:
Cabell brought to my attention that there appear to be some incorrect data in the “Counted” column under Voter Management > Election Participation History > Other Voter Participation History. The examples she provided are 100321341, 000748342, 000390976. The “YES” indicators in the counted column are correct, but she indicated that there is no way that these folks have voted multiple times, and it never counted.
I checked my own record, as I have never been issued a provisional ballot, so I’m certain all columns should read “YES.” If you could please take a look at mine (ID 100596405), that would be great. The trend I’m seeing is that the Counted column is correct from the 2022 Primary forward. Anything from the 2020 General to the 2016 Primary for me shows that the ballots were not counted. The username “ENETCONV” is all associated with the “NO” columns.
Another example I found was voter 000273186. Her provisional WAS counted, per our provisional ballot tracker and the ad hoc report. But the UI does not show that A) she was ever a provisional voter or B) that her vote was counted.
There was a related issue to the counted column previously, but it was supposed to be resolved:https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/753893993/pulses/7863664628. I’m wondering if this is also somehow related to the other ad-hoc tickets on the Monday board at the moment.

As an SVRS user
I would like to be able to generate ad hoc provisional ballot reports at the county level
So that they do not include all provisonal voters statewide
AC: Edit the VIEW_PROV_BALLOT query so that it pulls the county a voter belongs to so that the report can then be filtered by county, or create an alternative way to generate a provisonal ballot report at the county level
Notes from WV:
I generated an ad-hoc in Tyler County, and the source was "VIEW_PROV_BALLOT." I used all of the criteria, and the conditions were ID_ELECTION = 18869 for the General.
The report shows voters from all across the state, when I was only looking for Tyler County provisionals.

As a state user when attempting to click on the action menu for participation under the "View Voter Registration" page, the options are not visible. Instead, there is just a small bucket icon with no text. This makes it unclear what actions can be performed.
Expected Behavior:
The action menu should display VIEW but grayed out.
Actual Behavior:
The action menu displays only a small bucket icon with no text, and no options are visible.
Environment: All three environments
Navigate to the "View Voter Registration" page from the VM Module.
Locate a voter record.
Click on the action menu associated with the voter participation.
Observe that the options within the menu are not populated and the bucket icon appears without any text.
Add the Button view to state user and redirect to the page to view the information of participation.

When registering a voter, the user is presented with a "Prefix" dropdown field, where "Select" is an option. The user can select "Select" from the dropdown, and the registration proceeds successfully. However, if "Select" is chosen, the field should immediately turn red to indicate that this value is not valid and should not be selected, but currently, this validation does not occur. This causes confusion for the user, as the field remains unchanged and the registration is completed with an invalid value.
Navigate to the voter registration page.
In the "Prefix" dropdown, select the value "Select".
Complete the registration process by filling in the other required fields.
Submit the registration.
Expected Behavior
:
When "Select" is chosen in the "Prefix" dropdown, the field should immediately turn red, signaling that the value is invalid and must be corrected before continuing.
Actual Behavior
:
The "Prefix" field remains as is, and the user can proceed to complete the registration, even though "Select" is not a valid option.

AC: We need pollboooks generated by ward only due to split precinct boundaries and districts in Brooke County. This will include the city of Follansbee and Wellsburg. Below are the wards that need included for Follansbee:

Ward 2 - combo 63
Ward 3 - combos 60, 68, 74
Ward 4 - combos 61 and 64
Ward 5 - combos 62 and 67
There may be Follansbee Primary on 4/1/2025, and the General is 6/10/2025.
Wellsburg also has a 6/10/2025 election, but I am still waiting to hear back from Brooke about which wards and combos should be included.

AC: Which Voter participation pictured below is the correct one, find what caused the discrepancy
Notes from WV: Please see the screenshots below for Harrison County voter 100156957. Her audit history shows 2 instances of voter participation after cancellation. I did not believe this to be correct, as the system prohibits users from entering participation for cancelled voters.
However, her voter participation history does not show any indication of voter history.
Which one is correct? Why is there a discrepancy?

AC: Correct the Polling places in the voter file for the voter files shown
Hello,
Last week I reported that Mineral County had voters in the voter file having the incorrect county polling place compared to their record (
https://gocivix.monday.com/boards/753893993/pulses/7667136607
). Below are some new findings, and attached are lists of voters in the file who are affected. I have cross checked this list against alpha reports, the UI, and the polling place module.
Fayette
CPR 70
Poll place in the voter file = Thurmond Town Hall
(incorrect)
This location is only used for CCPR 13 voters
Poll place on UI, alpha list, and maintain polling place = Chestnut Knob Baptist Church
(correct)
Wayne
CPR 6
Poll place in the voter file = Fort Gay Town Hall
(incorrect)
This location is only used for CCPR 6 voters
Poll place on the UI, alpha list, and maintain polling place = Fort Gay Pre-K-8 06
(correct)
McDowell
CPR 50
Poll place in the voter file = Keystone Fire Dept
(incorrect)
This location is only used for CCPR 50 voters
Poll place on the UI, alpha list, and maintain polling place = Keystone City Hall
(correct)
Mineral
CPR 13
Poll place in the voter file = Ridgeley City Hall
(incorrect)
This location is listed under Maintain Polling Place, but there are no precincts/combos assigned.
Poll place on the UI, alpha list, and maintain polling place = The Life Center
(correct)
When looking at a voter’s record, it shows the right municipal polling location, but the street address is missing and there is a stray comma underneath the city.

As an SVRS user
I want to create a batch print
So that each registered voter has a complete voter registration card generated as expected
AC: The complete voter registration card should appear in batch print and the correct letters should be generated when a voter registration is complete
Notes from WV: Please see the attached spreadsheet from Randolph County’s batch print. There are several instances where the complete voter registration card is not appearing here. Additionally, there is one instance where 3 letters were generated – one disposition and 2 acceptances. There should have only been a disposition letter.

As an SVRS user
I want to be able to enter voter participation history for multiple voters
So that the enter button adds the history, not deletes it
AC: Clicking the "Enter" button should add multiple voter participation history
Notes from WV:
From Kanawha:
When entering multiple voter participation history, if they click the enter button when all 5 IDs are input, it defaults to "Delete" instead of "Add."

Issue:
The pagination for viewing voters on a specific street segment is set up incorrectly, checking the image below it seems as though it is using the same one that is being used by the street segments and not the one below the list of voters

So that it reflects the proper county where an individual voted
AC:
Tyler County voter 000854007 needs to be given for the 2010 General, the county listed should be WETZEL instead of Tyler.
Notes from WV:
After resolving a duplicate voter issue, we need to make a correction to voter history so that it reflects the proper county where the individual voted - not the county of the user who entered the history.
This is Tyler County voter 000854007. For the 2010 General, the county listed should be WETZEL instead of Tyler.

With the only filing cycle defined for the 2026 Election being a PAC filing cycle and that not set up to be assigned to candidates, a candidate filing to run in the 2026 election was assigned the 2026 PAC Election Cycle
As of 2/26/25 this is reproducible in QA and UAT. However, a 2026 Candidate Election cycle has been set up in Production since the deployment to Prod on 2/20/25. Without creating a new election and new PAC Election Cycle, it will not be reproducible in UAT after the next production deployment and refresh of the UAT database. Any change to the 2026 election and election cycles in QA will also require a new election and PAC cycle to reproduce the issue.

Issue 1:
After clicking on the search button, a warning popup is shown instead of continuing the process without errors.
Issue 2:
When a user navigates to the duplicate voter section and selects a search criteria, the system performs the search even if all necessary information is NOT provided based on the selected criteria. For instance, if "Voter Registration ID" is chosen as the search criterion and the user only enters one ID, the system still returns results without notifying the user that additional information is required.

HARRIS County - Large number of Error Code 1 mismatches in Harris County TEAM sync
Harris
County received over 50,000 Error Code 1 - "Voter In TEAM, not in
County" mismatches from last weekend's sync and in researching the issue
they see that these voters were part of their purge cancellation and
were all sent to TEAM in files on 01/23/2025. Due to the large number
of records
they were split into multiple files
and all of the files received a reference number when they were uploaded.
The files and reference numbers that were sent for these voters are:
101_20250123VOTER1
Reference #: 01222295
101_20250123VOTER12
Reference #: 01222306

101_20250123VOTER14 (was resent as 101_20250123VOTER141 also)
Reference #: 01222311
101_20250123VOTER141 (resent on 01/28/2025)
Reference #: 01223417
Votec
says they can send another cancellation record for these voters but
before uploading 50,000 records again I want to determine why they
weren't processed when they were originally sent as they do not see any
reason why they shouldn't have gone through.
County wants to know what do they have to do to resolve.

From Dave:
I’m trying to update a committee registration with a new
Treasurer and updating all other email addresses for the committee. The
email extensions are all .consulting and the system will not accept it. I
know we have run into this before. What can we do to fix that and is
there any way for us to be able to do it ourselves? This particular issue
is with
WAYNE WILLIAMS FOR NPPD 7 (ID: 21CAC10210)
. We need it to
allow
Wayne@isi.consulting
and
sheena@isi.consulting
so they can get
credentials and file an Annual statement which is already late.

Issue:
When a user navigates to the "Duplicate Voter" section to merge voters, selects a search criterion, and enters the necessary information before clicking "Search," the system no longer displays the comparison page as it did previously. Instead, it returns two constant results regardless of the search input. Additionally, the "Compare" button next to the results is not working, preventing the user from proceeding with the merge process
1. Login as Region User for Region_01
2. Click on Voter Management menu
3. Click on Duplicate Voter button
4. Select the Search Criteria: Voter Registration #
5. Enter Voter Registration #1
6. Enter Voter Registration #2
7. Click on Search button
Expected Result:
After entering the necessary information and clicking "Search," the system should display the appropriate results and direct the user to the comparison page.
Actual Result:
After selecting a search criterion and entering the required information, the system returns two constant results and does not navigate to the comparison page. The "Compare" button next to the results is also unresponsive.

Happening in production, replicated in UAT and QA
If a work order is submitted online with multiple transactions in a single work order, the receipts being generated are adding one transaction at a time, as it's approved. This is happening whether it's an online filing or a certificate of existence request (I didn't test the submit a paper filing option)
Example in QA: W2025022711502
4 transactions were submitted in this work order, and t
he following are the receipts that were sent for each filing - as you can see, the first receipt contains only the receipt for the one, the second receipt shows the first and second filings, the third receipt shows the first, second, and third filings, and the fourth receipt shows all 4 filings. Each receipt
shows the total charge in the Payment Information section for all 4 filings, but in the Fees section, it's not displaying all 4. I also see that the submitter account section is changing in each subsequent receipt. The receipts here should display similarly to the inhouse filings - where all 4 transactions that are part of a work order are displayed, and if any are still pending, that's what shows in the filing status section
:
first filing:
second filing:
third filing:
fourth filing:

Please update work order W2024091705459 back to a pending status so that it can be appropriately processed by a UT staff member.
This is an online filing that they force accepted before we took that option away, so the entity was never created. (should go to Queue Stage: Internal Review / Status: Submitted)

Please update entity 14529278-0160 to display the filing history from W20241230247662 /
241230141542B

Please update Name Held Date on
﻿
9581091-0160 (
﻿
GREENS HOSPITALITY, LLC.) to blank/null so the name will be available

Entity 14524513-0160 is a Domestic Limited Liability Company, with a regular LLC classification, but Optometrist is showing as the profession. We need to update this so it's not showing Optometrist.
We should also check to see if there are others like this - a profession should ONLY show if the classification is Professional.

RSLC PAC 465618 participated in the special election and filed an IE on 2/21. We didn’t know that they participated, so we didn’t add the special election reports to their schedule until today.
The
first
problem
is that the contributions and expenditures that should appear on the 11-Day report are in the system, but not showing up on the report. Can you and your team get them to show up on the 11-Day so that they can file the report, which even in preview shows zeros.
The
second problem
is easier, I think. I deleted a 24 hour report for the 2/13 $200 expenditure that they needed to file. Can you reinstate it

Highlight both the current and suggested values for clarity.

(2 issues) I was looking at the DPS & TX online Dashboard for Travis county.
DPS:
I see many DUPs for DPS. Can you please check on this? I ran the Outstanding Task report # 001195105.
These are JUST A FEW/Samples of DPS apps that show dups
in the Dashboard/same task opened date.
TX ONLINE:
Texas online apps for the files posted show dates of 2/13 to count 2/28 which appears correct and their count is 62. The Dashboard bucket in TEAM shows 5,301. I ran report# 001195107
It appears that the Bucket should only show those 62 applications instead of the additional 5,239 apps that must have already been sent to the county prior to 2/13.

Wayne County needs some adjustments made to a street - Perry Cambell (Prichard). When searching the street, it appears properly in Prichard. However, the segment itself reads "Fort Gay" under Postal City. The voters themselves are appearing in Fort Gay upon doing a voter search, and they need to appear in Prichard. Further, the ZIP needs to be changed to 25555.

Need export of all candidate Contributions and Expenditures, unable to get them from the public site.
The filters on the public site are not working correctly, this will require a program change it's not just an SQL change.
For this one there were only 89 Contributions and 20 Expenditures, so I was able to copy and past from the Secure Site

Zavala County
--
VR card (Valid date) generated by TEAM is incorrect
. Zavala
county noticed that TEAM is not generating the VR card with the correct
valid from dates during a replacement VR card process for
ONE
voter. All other replacements cards have been correct. Only issue so far for this one voter.
It looks like TEAM is using the EDR date as the valid date, see snip#2 below.
VUID: 2205312056
TEAM PATH:
Activities > Voter List Maintenance >
Replacement VR Card
Preliminary Research Conducted:
In
TEAM Looking up the voter through Inquiry - Search - Voter
Registration, to verify if voter is active (see snip#2).
In
TEAM, looking up the voter through Activities > Voter List
Maintenance > Replacement VR Card, county printed 3 times the
VR card none of them had the correct dates.
Tested in TRAINING,
looking up the voter through Activities > Voter List
Maintenance > Replacement VR Card to print the VR card of
another active voter in Zavala county with this time the correct
dates.
Snip#1:

County Name: Hays & Walker
Issue Summary:
Walker county received a DPS application to their dashboard. The
voter has always been active in Walker county. The voter one time
back in 2016 sent an application to Hays county however Hays had
marked it as an incomplete. Hays county used to be offline county
and they think that it was never cleared in TEAM back then. Now
they are online county. Hays county checked their dashboard and
there is no incomplete application there. Hays county investigated that
the incomplete application was from 2016. Tried to reject it but it
doesn’t let her so that Walker county can process the DPS application.
Hays Approval:
"Hays
County gives permission to remove Jordan Matthew Floyd, VUID
1198302826, from incomplete status in Hays County dating back to an
incomplete application in 2016 due to his active voter file existing in
Walker County."
TEAM PATH:
Activities > Search Voter > vuid 1198302826 JORDAN FLOYD
Snip#1: Logged in as Walker county, when they try to select voter to update, they get the below message.
SNIP #2: Logged in as HAYS COUNTY, the only way they could
possibly do something is by going through activities>voter
registration>transfer voter BUT the date states 11/08/2016 and they
don’t want to mess anything up and I think it won’t even let them as
Walker county has a most recent registration date

When Tyler Tech was reviewing Hays County Jury Wheeljwh10520250214112459, for 2025, they discovered some jurors have the same address listed twice in a single row.See Below:
We took a look at the highlighted names from last year’s impromptu reconstitution 2024 Jury Wheel, and they appear with the same address twice as well. If you look back at 2023 and 2022 the text file only show the addresses listed once.Tyler asking for a corrected version that matches the format of the previous files. Please let us know as soon as possible, as this could impact their SLU timeline.

I opened it up online from the public entity search site and it was just fine
UT user logging in and searched once logged in, it threw the file not found error
Then I logged in and searched and it did the same thing
THEN I went back inhouse to open it again, and now it's only opening the rejection letters that got sent out, and no stamped file copy
I think maybe what we should do is set it up so that the online side can't regenerate - that can only happen when trying to open the image from inhouse. Maybe that'll solve part of these issues.

Wayne County identified a street that is in the system multiple times with a variety of spellings. They are seeking to remove the misspelled, duplicated segments and combine them all into one. The correct spelling is "Haney's Branch Rd (Huntington)," and there are several duplicated versions spelled like "Haney's Br Rd," "Haynes Branch Rd," or "Haynies Br." Below is the street that needs to remain:
Attached is a list of voters from Wayne that need moved from the incorrect, misspelled streets and placed on the proper street. Can these folks be moved to the street above using a backend fix? Or will Wayne County have to move each voter individually? Further, once this is complete, can we get rid of the empty streets that these voters were moved from?

When a Lobbyists adds an unregistered Employer to their registration, it is showing up on the Registration PDF, but not being displayed on the Lobbyist's dashboard list of Employers. This is leading to confusion.
The initial report was from a filer who amended their own registration to add an unregistered Employer. Needs to be tested as both a filer and as an admin working on behalf of the filer.
Link to Monday item:

Login to the Lobbyist module as a Lobbyist
Amend the registration
Add a Non-registered Employer
Submit the registration
Login as an Admin
Conditionally approve the just submitted registration
work on behalf of the Lobbyist
View the Registration PDF
View the Employer list on the dashboard
Expected Results:
Unregistered Employer should be listed on the dashboard as well as on the Registration PDF but should not be authorized
Actual Results:
Unregistered Employer is listed on the dashboard but is now displaying as authorized
Changed the stored procedure:
[usp_Lobbyist_Admin_Get_ClientInformation]

The formation date for this DBA is 11/08/2012. Per the migration site, their Expiration Date when migrated was set to 11/30/24. I don't know what exactly happened here, but something happened that updated their Expiration Date to 12/6/2030 instead. It should be set to 11/30/27.
For this bug, we need to:
Identify what updated that Expiration Date incorrectly, and fix it if it's still an issue
Find any other DBAs (or BTs or GPs) where the Expiration Date month
does not match
the Formation Date month, and correct them.
Find any other DBAs (or BTs or GPs) where the Expiration Date year is not correct based on the formation date and renewal history
Assumed Name (DBA)s and Domestic Business Trusts have a 3-year renewal window. So the Expiration Date year should be 3 years after their renewal date (if they renewed in our system). If they did not renew in our system, we may not have the details of when they last renewed, but the Expiration Date year should be a multiple of 3 years after their formation date (3, 6, 9, 12, etc)
Domestic General Partnerships have a 5-year renewal window. So the Expiration Date year should be 5 years after their renewal date (if they renewed in our system). If they did not renew in our system, we may not have the details of when they last renewed, but the Expiration Date year should be a multiple of 5 years after their formation date (5, 10, 15, 20, etc)

Total page count in the file stamp and the page number in the footer are not working correctly for system generated stamped file copies:
The total page count always displays 1 in the file stamp (I believe it displays correctly for inhouse filing images).
The page number at the bottom always displays "Page 0 of X" instead of "Page 1 of 1" or "Page 1 of 2" - the second number seems to work right, but not the first one

WV needs a list of voters who have been processed with "No Change"
Currently there is no audit history for those who have been processed as "no change". Since there is no audit history this may hinder their ability when sending confirmation notices to voters who have been idle. They need the list to exclude those from receiving the confirmation notice.

Amending the registration of an Employer to change the name of the Authorizing Officer results in a new active person record linked to the amended Member and Registration records while not inactivating the prior Authorizing Officer record. As a result, searching for the former Authorizing Officer in the Work on Behalf screen apparently returns a link to a former version of the Employer with the data that existed prior to the amendment.
This issue was reported in Production and has been recreated in QA via the Repro Steps below. it should be reproducible for any Employer by following similar steps.
Linked to Monday item:

Login to Lobbyist module
Work on behalf of an Employer (I used ID
434412 - Hims and Hers Health, Inc)
Maker a note of the Authorizing Officer's name and the contact email for the Employer
Amend the registration
Change the name of the Authorizing Officer - not a variation, but a completely different name
Change the contact email address for the Employer
Submit the amendment
Exit Work on Behalf
Accept the amendment
Duplicate the browser tab
In the first tab, open the Work on Behalf search
Search on the last name of the NEW Authorizing Officer
Select the Employer you amended if multiple options are presented
In the second tab
, open the Work on Behalf search
Search on the last name of the OLD Authorizing Officer
Select the Employer you amended if multiple options are presented
Compare the data on the two tabs
In the database, query the Member, Registration, and Person tables for the MemberID of the Employer (see first comment for queries)
Expected Results:
Searching on a prior Authorizing Officer should present the current version of the registration.
Searching on the current Authorizing Officer should present the current version of the registration.
After the amendment, on the filer dashboard there should be two authorizing officers listed, one Active and one Inactive (Figure 2)
In the database, there should be a separate Person record for each Authorizing Officer
Actual Results:
Searching on a prior Authorizing Officer presents an older version of the registration. (Figure 1)
Searching on the current Authorizing Officer presents the current version of the registration.(Figure 2)
After the amendment the filer dashboard shows one authorizing officers listed based on which officer was searched for
In the database, there is a single Person record with different versions for each Authorizing Officer
